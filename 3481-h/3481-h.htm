<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the whole of Borrow&rsquo;s
manhood there was probably only one period when he was
unquestionably happy in his work and content with his
surroundings.&nbsp; He may almost be said to have concentrated
into the seven years (1833&ndash;1840) that he was employed by
the British and Foreign Bible Society in Russia, Portugal and
Spain, a lifetime&rsquo;s energy and resource.&nbsp; From an
unknown hack-writer, who hawked about unsaleable translations of
Welsh and Danish bards, a travelling tinker and a vagabond
Ulysses, he became a person of considerable importance.&nbsp; His
name was acclaimed with praise and enthusiasm at Bible meetings
from one end of the country to the other.&nbsp; He developed an
astonishing aptitude for affairs, a tireless energy, and a
diplomatic resourcefulness that aroused silent wonder in those
who had hitherto regarded him as a failure.&nbsp; His illegal
imprisonment in Madrid nearly brought about a diplomatic rupture
between Great Britain and Spain, and later his missionary work in
the Peninsula was referred to by Sir Robert Peel in the House of
Commons as an instance of what could be achieved by courage and
determination in the face of great difficulties.</p>
<p>Those seven rich and productive years realised to the full the
strange talents and unsuspected abilities of George
Borrow&rsquo;s unique character.&nbsp; He himself referred to the
period spent in Spain as the &ldquo;five happiest years&rdquo; of
his life.&nbsp; When, however, his life came to be written by Dr
Knapp, than whom no biographer has approved himself more loyal or
enthusiastic, it was found that the records of that period were
not accessible.&nbsp; The letters that he had addressed to the
Bible Society had been mislaid.&nbsp; These came to light shortly
after the publication of Dr Knapp&rsquo;s work, and type-written
copies were placed at my disposal by the General Committee long
before they were given to the public in volume form.</p>
<p>A systematic search at the Public Record Office has revealed a
wealth of unpublished documents, including a lengthy letter from
Borrow relating to his imprisonment at Seville in 1839.&nbsp;
From other sources much valuable information and many interesting
anecdotes have been obtained, and through the courtesy of their
possessor a number of unpublished Borrow letters are either
printed in their entirety or are quoted from in this volume.</p>
<p>My thanks are due in particular to the Committee of British
and Foreign Bible Society for placing at my disposal the copies
of the Borrow Letters, and also for permission to reproduce the
interesting silhouette of the Rev. Andrew Brandram, and to the
Rev. T. H. Darlow, M.A. (Literary Superintendent), whose uniform
kindness and desire to assist me I find it impossible adequately
to acknowledge.&nbsp; My thanks are also due to the Rt. Hon. Sir
Edward Grey, M.P., for permission to examine the despatches from
the British Embassy at Madrid at the Record Office, and the
Registers of Passports at the Foreign Office, and to Mr F. H.
Bowring (son of Sir John Bowring), Mr Wilfrid J. Bowring (who has
placed at my disposal a number of letters from Borrow to his
grandfather), Mr R. W. Brant, Mr Ernest H. Caddie, Mr William
Canton, Mr S. D. Charles, an ardent Borrovian from whom I have
received much kindness and many valuable suggestions, Mr A. I.
Dasent, the editors of <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> and <i>The
Bookman</i>, Mr Thomas Hake, Mr D. B. Hill of Mattishall,
Norfolk, Mr James Hooper, Mr W. F. T. Jarrold (for permission to
reproduce the hitherto unpublished portrait of Borrow painted by
his brother), Dr F. G. Kenyon, C.B., Mr F. A. Mumby, Mr George
Porter of Denbigh (for interesting particulars about
Borrow&rsquo;s first visit to Wales), Mr Theodore Rossi, Mr
Theodore Watts-Dunton, Mr Thomas Vade-Walpole, who have all
responded to my appeal for help with great willingness.</p>
<p>To one friend, who elects to be nameless, I am deeply grateful
for many valuable suggestions and much help; but above all for
the keen interest he has taken in a work which he first
encouraged me to write.&nbsp; To her who gave so plentifully of
her leisure in transcribing documents at the Record Office and in
research work at the British Museum and elsewhere, I am indebted
beyond all possibility of acknowledgment.&nbsp; To no one more
than to Mr John Murray are my acknowledgments due for his
unfailing kindness, patience and assistance.&nbsp; It is no
exaggeration to state that but for his aid and encouragement this
book could not have been written.</p>

<p><i>January</i>, 1912.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I:<br />
1678&ndash;MAY 1816</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> 28th July 1783 was held the
annual fair at Menheniot, and for miles round the country folk
flocked into the little Cornish village to join in the
festivities.&nbsp; Among the throng was a strong contingent of
young men from Liskeard, a town three miles distant, between whom
and the youth of Menheniot an ancient feud existed.&nbsp; In days
when the bruisers of England were national heroes, and a fight
was a fitting incident of a day&rsquo;s revelry, the very
presence of their rivals was a sufficient challenge to the
chivalry of Menheniot, and a contest became inevitable.&nbsp;
Some unrecorded incident was accepted by both parties as a
sufficient cause for battle, and the two factions were soon
fighting furiously midst collapsing stalls and tumbled
merchandise.&nbsp; Women shrieked and fainted, men shouted and
struck out grimly, whilst the stall-holders, in a frenzy of grief
and despair, wrung their hands helplessly as they saw their goods
being trampled to ruin beneath the feet of the contestants.</p>
<p>Slowly the men of Liskeard were borne back by their more
numerous opponents.&nbsp; They wavered, and just as defeat seemed
inevitable, there arrived upon the scene a young man who, on
seeing his townsmen in danger of being beaten, placed himself at
their head and charged down upon the enemy, forcing them back by
the impetuosity of his attack.</p>
<p>The new arrival was a man of fine physique, above the medium
height and a magnificent fighter, who, later in life, was to
achieve something of which a Mendoza or a Belcher might have been
proud.&nbsp; He fought strongly and silently, inspiring his
fellow townsmen by his example.&nbsp; The new leader had entirely
turned the tide of battle, but just as the defeat of the men of
Menheniot seemed certain, a diversion was created by the arrival
of the local constables.&nbsp; Now that their own villagers were
on the verge of disaster, there was no longer any reason why they
should remain in the background.&nbsp; They made a determined
effort to arrest the leader of the Liskeard contingent, and were
promptly knocked down by him.</p>
<p>At that moment Mr Edmund Hambley, a much-respected maltster
and the headborough of Liskeard, was attracted to the spot.&nbsp;
Seeing in the person of the outrageous leader of the battle one
of his own apprentices, he stepped forward and threatened him
with arrest.&nbsp; Goaded to desperation by the scornful attitude
of the young man, the master-maltster laid hands upon him, and
instantly shared the fate of the constables.&nbsp; With great
courage and determination the headborough rose to his feet and
again attempted to enforce his authority, but with no better
result.&nbsp; When he picked himself up for a second time, it was
to pass from the scene of his humiliation and, incidentally, out
of the life of the young man who had defied his authority.</p>
<p>The young apprentice was Thomas Borrow (born December 1758),
eighth and posthumous child of John Borrow and of Mary his wife,
of Trethinnick (the House on the Hill), in the neighbouring
parish of St Cleer, two and a half miles north of Liskeard.&nbsp;
At the age of fifteen, Thomas had begun to work upon his
father&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; At nineteen he was apprenticed to
Edmund Hambley, maltster, of Liskeard, who five years later, in
his official capacity as Constable of the Hundred of Liskeard,
was to be publicly defied and twice knocked down by his
insubordinate apprentice.</p>
<p>A trifling affair in itself, this village fracas was to have a
lasting effect upon the career of Thomas Borrow.&nbsp; He was
given to understand by his kinsmen that he need not look to them
for sympathy or assistance in his wrongdoing.&nbsp; The Borrows
of Trethinnick could trace back further than the parish registers
record (1678).&nbsp; They were godly and law-abiding people, who
had stood for the king and lost blood and harvests in his
cause.&nbsp; If a son of the house disgrace himself, the
responsibility must be his, not theirs.&nbsp; In the opinion of
his family, Thomas Borrow had, by his vigorous conduct towards
the headborough, who was also his master, placed himself outside
the radius of their sympathy.&nbsp; At this period Trethinnick, a
farm of some fifty acres in extent, was in the hands of Henry,
Thomas&rsquo; eldest brother, who since his mother&rsquo;s death,
ten years before, had assumed the responsibility of launching his
youngest brother upon the world.</p>
<p>Fearful of the result of his assault on the headborough,
Thomas Borrow left St Cleer with great suddenness, and for five
months disappeared entirely.&nbsp; On 29th December he presented
himself as a recruit before Captain Morshead, <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> in command of a detachment of the
Coldstream Guards, at that time stationed in the duchy.</p>
<p>Thomas Borrow was no stranger to military training.&nbsp; For
five years he had been in the Yeomanry Militia, which involved a
short annual training.&nbsp; In the regimental records he is
credited with five years &ldquo;former service.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remained for eight years with the Coldstream Guards, most of the
time being passed in London barracks.&nbsp; He had no money with
which to purchase a commission, and his rise was slow and
deliberate.&nbsp; At the end of nine months he was promoted to
the rank of corporal, and five years later he became a
sergeant.&nbsp; In 1792 he was transferred as Sergeant-Major to
the First, or West Norfolk Regiment of Militia, whose
headquarters were at East Dereham in Norfolk.</p>
<p>It was just previous to this transfer that Sergeant Borrow had
his famous encounter in Hyde Park with Big Ben Bryan, the
champion of England; he &ldquo;whose skin was brown and dusky as
that of a toad.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a combat in which &ldquo;even
Wellington or Napoleon would have been heartily glad to cry for
quarter ere the lapse of five minutes, and even the Blacksmith
Tartar would, perhaps, have shrunk from the opponent with whom,
after having had a dispute with him,&rdquo; Sergeant Borrow
&ldquo;engaged in single combat for one hour, at the end of which
time the champions shook hands and retired, each having
experienced quite enough of the other&rsquo;s prowess.&rdquo; <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a></p>
<p>At East Dereham Thomas Borrow met Ann <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> Perfrement, <a name="citation4c"></a><a
href="#footnote4c" class="citation">[4c]</a> a strikingly
handsome girl of twenty, whose dark eyes first flashed upon him
from over the footlights.&nbsp; It was, and still is, the custom
for small touring companies to engage their supernumeraries in
the towns in which they were playing.&nbsp; The pretty daughter
of Farmer Perfrement, whose farm lay about one and a half miles
out of East Dereham, was one of those who took occasion to earn a
few shillings for pin-money.&nbsp; The Perfrements were of
Huguenot stock.&nbsp; On the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
their ancestors had fled from their native town of Caen and taken
refuge in East Anglia, there to enjoy the liberty of conscience
denied them in their beloved Normandy.&nbsp; Thomas Borrow made
the acquaintance of the young probationer, and promptly settled
any aspirations that she may have had towards the stage by
marrying her.&nbsp; The wedding took place on 11th February 1793
at East Dereham church, best known as the resting-place of the
poet Cowper, Ann being twenty-one and Thomas thirty-four years of
age.</p>
<p>For the next seven years Thomas and Ann Borrow moved about
with the West Norfolk Militia, which now marched off into Essex,
a few months later doubling back again into Norfolk.&nbsp; Then
it dived into Kent and for a time hovered about the Cinque Ports,
Thomas Borrow in the meantime being promoted to the rank of
quarter-master (27th May 1795).&nbsp; It was not until he had
completed fourteen years of service that he received a
commission.&nbsp; On 27th February 1798 he became Adjutant in the
same regiment, a promotion that carried with it a captain&rsquo;s
rank.</p>
<p>Whilst at Sandgate Mrs Borrow became acquainted with John
Murray, the son of the founder of the publishing house from
which, forty-four years later, were to be published the books of
her second son, then unborn.&nbsp; The widow of John Murray the
First had married in 1795 Lieutenant Henry Paget of the West
Norfolk Militia.&nbsp; Years later (27th March 1843) George
Borrow wrote to John Murray, Junr., third of the line:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am at present in Norwich with my mother,
who has been ill, but is now, thank God, recovering fast.&nbsp;
She begs leave to send her kind remembrances to Mr Murray.&nbsp;
She knew him at Sandgate in Kent <i>forty-six</i> years ago, when
he came to see his mother, Mrs P[aget].&nbsp; She was also
acquainted with his sister, Miss Jane Murray, <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> who used to ride on horseback with her
on the Downs.&nbsp; She says Captain [<i>sic</i>] Paget once
cooked a dinner for Mrs P. and herself; and sat down to table
with his cook&rsquo;s apron on.&nbsp; Is not this funny?&nbsp;
Does it not &lsquo;beat the Union,&rsquo; as the Yankees
say?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first child of the marriage was born in 1800, it is not
known exactly when or where.&nbsp; This was John, &ldquo;the
brother some three years older than myself,&rdquo; whose beauty
in infancy was so great &ldquo;that people, especially those of
the poorer classes, would follow the nurse who carried him about
in order to look at and bless his lovely face,&rdquo; <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> with its rosy cheeks and smiling,
blue-eyed innocence.&nbsp; On one occasion even, an attempt was
made to snatch him from the arms of his nurse as she was about to
enter a coach.&nbsp; The parents became a prey to anxiety; for
the child seems to have possessed many endearing qualities as
well as good looks.&nbsp; He was quick and clever, and when the
time came for instruction, &ldquo;he mastered his letters in a
few hours, and in a day or two could decipher the names of people
on the doors of houses and over the shop windows.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; His cleverness increased as he
grew up, and later he seems to have become, in the mind of
Captain Borrow at least, a standard by which to measure the
shortcomings of his younger son George, whom he never was able to
understand.</p>
<p>For the next three years, 1800&ndash;3, the regiment continued
to hover about the home counties.&nbsp; The Peace of Amiens
released many of the untried warriors, who had enlisted
&ldquo;until the peace,&rdquo; their adjutant having to find new
recruits to fill up the gaps.&nbsp; War broke out again the
following year (18th May 1803), and the Great Terror assumed a
phase so critical as to subdue almost entirely all thought of
party strife.&nbsp; On 5th July Ann Borrow gave birth to a second
son, in the house of her father.&nbsp; At the time Captain Borrow
was hunting for recruits in other parts of Norfolk, in order to
send them to Colchester, where the regiment was stationed.&nbsp;
In due course the child was christened George Henry <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a> at the church of East Dereham, and,
within a few weeks of his birth, he received his first experience
of the vicissitudes of a soldier&rsquo;s life, by accompanying
his father, mother, and brother to Colchester to rejoin the
regiment.&nbsp; The whole infancy of George Borrow was spent in
the same trailing restlessness.&nbsp; Napoleon was alive and at
large, and the West Norfolks seemed doomed eternally to march and
countermarch in the threatened area, Sussex, Kent, Essex.</p>
<p>No efforts appear to have been made to steal the younger
brother, although &ldquo;people were in the habit of standing
still to look at me, ay, more than at my brother.&rdquo; <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; Unlike John in about everything
that one child could be unlike another, George was a gloomy,
introspective creature who considerably puzzled his
parents.&nbsp; He compares himself to &ldquo;a deep, dark lagoon,
shaded by black pines, cypresses and yews,&rdquo; <a
name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a> beside which he once paused to
contemplate &ldquo;a beautiful stream . . . sparkling in the
sunshine, and . . . tumbling merrily into cascades,&rdquo; <a
name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a> which he likened to his brother.</p>
<p>Slow of comprehension, almost dull-witted, shy of society,
sometimes bursting into tears when spoken to, George became
&ldquo;a lover of nooks and retired corners,&rdquo; <a
name="citation7e"></a><a href="#footnote7e"
class="citation">[7e]</a> where he would sit for hours at a time
a prey to &ldquo;a peculiar heaviness . . . and at times . . . a
strange sensation of fear, which occasionally amounted to
horror,&rdquo; <a name="citation7f"></a><a href="#footnote7f"
class="citation">[7f]</a> for which there was no apparent
cause.&nbsp; In time he grew to be as much disliked as his
brother was admired.&nbsp; On one occasion an old Jew pedlar,
attracted by the latent intelligence in the smouldering eyes of
the silent child, who ignored his questions and continued tracing
in the dust with his fingers curious lines, pronounced him
&ldquo;a prophet&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;&nbsp; This carried to the
mother&rsquo;s heart a quiet comfort; and reawakened in her hope
for the future of her second son.</p>

<p>The early childhood of George Borrow was spent in stirring
times.&nbsp; Without, there was the menace of Napoleon&rsquo;s
invasion; within, every effort was being made to meet and repel
it.&nbsp; Dumouriez was preparing his great scheme of defence;
Captain Thomas Borrow was doing his utmost to collect and drill
men to help in carrying it into effect.&nbsp; Sometimes the
family were in lodgings; but more frequently in barracks, for
reasons of economy.&nbsp; Once, at least, they lived under
canvas.</p>
<p>The strange and puzzling child continued to impress his
parents in a manner well-calculated to alarm them.&nbsp; One day,
with a cry of delight, he seized a viper that, &ldquo;like a line
of golden light,&rdquo; was moving across the lane in which he
was playing.&nbsp; Whilst making no effort to harm the child, who
held and regarded it with awe and admiration, the reptile showed
its displeasure towards John, his brother, by hissing and raising
its head as if to strike.&nbsp; This happened when George was
between two and three years of age.&nbsp; At about the same
period he ate largely of some poisonous berries, which resulted
in &ldquo;strong convulsions,&rdquo; lasting for several
hours.&nbsp; He seems to have been a source of constant anxiety
to his parents, who were utterly unable to understand the strange
and gloomy child who had been vouchsafed to them by the
inscrutable decree of providence.</p>
<p>In the middle of the year 1809 the regiment returned from
Essex to Norfolk, marching first to Norwich and thence to other
towns in the county.&nbsp; Captain Borrow and his family took up
their quarters once more at Dereham.&nbsp; George was now six
years old, acutely observant of the things that interested him,
but reluctant to proceed with studies which, in his eyes, seemed
to have nothing to recommend them.&nbsp; Books possessed no
attraction for him, although he knew his alphabet and could even
read imperfectly.&nbsp; The acquirement of book-learning he found
a dull and dolorous business, to which he was driven only by the
threats or entreaties of his parents, who showed some concern
lest he should become an &ldquo;arrant dunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intelligence that the old Jew pedlar had discovered still
lay dormant, as if unwilling to manifest itself.&nbsp; The boy
loved best &ldquo;to look upon the heavens, and to bask in the
rays of the sun, or to sit beneath hedgerows and listen to the
chirping of the birds, indulging the while in musing and
meditation.&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; Meanwhile John was earning golden
opinions for the astonishing progress he continued to make at
school, unconsciously throwing into bolder relief the apparent
dullness of his younger brother.&nbsp; George, however, was as
active mentally as the elder.&nbsp; The one was studying men, the
other books.&nbsp; George was absorbing impressions of the things
around him: of the quaint old Norfolk town, its &ldquo;clean but
narrow streets branching out from thy modest market-place, with
thine old-fashioned houses, with here and there a roof of
venerable thatch&rdquo;; of that exquisite old gentlewoman Lady
Fenn, <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> as she passed to and from her mansion
upon some errand of bounty or of mercy, &ldquo;leaning on her
gold-headed cane, whilst the sleek old footman walked at a
respectful distance behind.&rdquo; <a name="citation9c"></a><a
href="#footnote9c" class="citation">[9c]</a>&nbsp; On Sundays,
from the black leather-covered seat in the church-pew, he would
contemplate with large-eyed wonder the rector and James Philo his
clerk, &ldquo;as they read their respective portions of the
venerable liturgy,&rdquo; sometimes being lulled to sleep by the
monotonous drone of their voices.</p>
<p>On fine Sundays there was the evening walk &ldquo;with my
mother and brother&mdash;a quiet, sober walk, during which I
would not break into a run, even to chase a butterfly, or yet
more a honey-bee, being fully convinced of the dread importance
of the day which God had hallowed.&nbsp; And how glad I was when
I had got over the Sabbath day without having done anything to
profane it.&nbsp; And how soundly I slept on the Sabbath night
after the toil of being very good throughout the day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a></p>
<p>During these early years there was being photographed upon the
brain of George Borrow a series of impressions which, to the end
of his life, remained as vivid as at the moment they were
absorbed.&nbsp; What appeared to those around him as dull-witted
stupidity was, in reality, mental surfeit.&nbsp; His mind was
occupied with other things than books, things that it eagerly
took cognisance of, strove to understand and was never to forget.
<a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a>&nbsp; Hitherto he had taken &ldquo;no
pleasure in books . . . and bade fair to be as arrant a dunce as
ever brought the blush of shame into the cheeks of anxious and
affectionate parents.&rdquo; <a name="citation10c"></a><a
href="#footnote10c" class="citation">[10c]</a>&nbsp; His mind was
not ready for them.&nbsp; When the time came there was no
question of dullness: he proved an eager and earnest student.</p>
<p>One day an intimate friend of Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s, who was also
godmother to John, brought with her a present of a book for each
of the two boys, a history of England for the elder and for the
younger <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.&nbsp; Instantly George became
absorbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true chord had now been touched . . . Weeks
succeeded weeks, months followed months, and the wondrous volume
was my only study and principal source of amusement.&nbsp; For
hours together I would sit poring over a page till I had become
acquainted with the import of every line.&nbsp; My progress, slow
enough at first, became by degrees more rapid, till at last,
under a &lsquo;shoulder of mutton sail,&rsquo; I found myself
cantering before a steady breeze over an ocean of enchantment, so
well pleased with my voyage that I cared not how long it might be
ere it reached its termination.&nbsp; And it was in this manner
that I first took to the paths of knowledge.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1810 the regiment was ordered to Norman
Cross, in Huntingdonshire, situated at the junction of the
Peterborough and Great North Roads.&nbsp; At this spot the
Government had caused to be erected in 1796 an extensive prison,
covering forty acres of ground, in which to confine some of the
prisoners made during the Napoleonic wars.&nbsp; There were
sixteen large buildings roofed with red tiles.&nbsp; Each group
of four was surrounded by a palisade, whilst another palisade
&ldquo;lofty and of prodigious strength&rdquo; surrounded the
whole.&nbsp; At the time when the West Norfolk Militia arrived
there were some six thousand prisoners, who, with their guards,
constituted a considerable-sized township.&nbsp; From time to
time fresh batches of captives arrived amid a storm of cheers and
cries of &ldquo;Vive L&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo;&nbsp; These were
the only incidents in the day&rsquo;s monotony, save when some
prisoner strove to evade the hospitality of King George, and was
shot for his ingratitude.</p>
<p>Captain Borrow rejoined his regiment at Norman Cross,
leaving his family to follow a few days later.&nbsp; At the time
the country round Peterborough was under water owing to the
recent heavy rains, and at one portion of the journey the whole
party had to embark in a species of punt, which was towed by
horses &ldquo;up to the knees in water, and, on coming to blind
pools and &lsquo;greedy depths,&rsquo; were not unfrequently
swimming.&rdquo; <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; But they were all old
campaigners and accepted such adventures as incidents of a
soldier&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>At Norman Cross George made the acquaintance of an old
snake-catcher and herbalist, a circumstance which, insignificant
in itself, was to exercise a considerable influence over his
whole life.&nbsp; Frequently this curious pair were to be seen
tramping the countryside together; a tall, quaint figure with fur
cap and gaiters carrying a leathern bag of wriggling venom, and
an eager child with eyes that now burned with interest and
intelligence&mdash;and the talk of the two was the lore of the
viper.&nbsp; When the snake-catcher passed out of the life of his
young disciple, he left behind him as a present a tame and
fangless viper, which George often carried with him on his
walks.&nbsp; It was this well-meaning and inoffensive viper that
turned aside the wrath of Gypsy Smith, <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> and awakened in his heart a
superstitious awe and veneration for the child, the
<i>Sap-engro</i>, who might be a goblin, but who certainly would
make a most admirable &ldquo;clergyman and God Almighty,&rdquo;
who read from a book that contained the kind of prayers
particularly to his taste&mdash;perhaps the greatest encomium
ever bestowed upon the immortal <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.&nbsp;
Thus it came about that George Borrow was proclaimed brother to
the gypsy&rsquo;s son Ambrose, <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a> who as Jasper
Petulengro figures so largely in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The
Romany Rye</i>, and is credited with that exquisitely phrased
pagan glorification of mere existence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Life is sweet, brother . . . There&rsquo;s
night and day, brother, both sweet things; sun, moon and stars,
brother, all sweet things; there&rsquo;s likewise the wind on the
heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet, brother; who would wish to
die?&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Borrows were nomads, permitted by God and the king to
tarry not over long in any one place.&nbsp; In the following July
(1811) the West Norfolks proceeded to Colchester <i>via</i>
Norfolk, after fifteen months of prison duty and straw-plait
destroying. <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; Captain Borrow betook himself to
East Dereham again to seek for likely recruits.&nbsp; In the
meantime George made his first acquaintance with that universal
specific for success in life, for correctness of conduct, for
soundness of principles&mdash;Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, which
to learn by heart was to acquire a virtue that defied evil.&nbsp;
The good old pedagogue who advocated Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar
as a remedy for all ills, would have traced George Borrow&rsquo;s
eventual success in life entirely to the fact that within three
years of the date that the solemn exhortation was pronounced the
boy had learned Lilly by heart, although without in the least
degree comprehending him.</p>
<p>Early in 1812 the regiment turned its head north, and by slow
degrees, with occasional counter marchings, continued to progress
towards Edinburgh, which was reached thirteen months later (6th
April 1813).&nbsp; &ldquo;With drums beating, colours flying, and
a long train of baggage-waggons behind,&rdquo; <a
name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a> the West Norfolk Militia wound its way
up the hill to the Castle, the adjutant&rsquo;s family in a
chaise forming part of the procession.&nbsp; There in barracks
the regiment might rest itself after long and weary marches, and
the two young sons of the adjutant be permitted to continue their
studies at the High School, without the probability that the
morrow would see them on the road to somewhere else.</p>
<p>Whilst at Edinburgh George met with his first experience of
racial feeling, which, under uncongenial conditions, develops
into race-hatred.&nbsp; He discovered that one English boy, when
faced by a throng of young Scots patriots, had best be silent as
to the virtues of his own race.&nbsp; He joined in and enjoyed
the fights between the &ldquo;Auld and the New Toon,&rdquo; and
incidentally acquired a Scots accent that somewhat alarmed his
loyal father, who had named him after the Hanoverian
Georges.&nbsp; Proving himself a good fighter, he earned the
praise of his Scots acquaintances, and a general invitation to
assist them in their &ldquo;bickers&rdquo; with &ldquo;thae New
Toon blackguards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He loved to climb and clamber over the rocks, peeping into
&ldquo;all manner of strange crypts, crannies, and recesses,
where owls nestled and the weasel brought forth her
young.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would go out on all-day excursions,
enjoying the thrills of clambering up to what appeared to be
inaccessible ledges, until eventually he became an expert
cragsman.&nbsp; One day he came upon David Haggart <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> sitting on the extreme verge of a
precipice, &ldquo;thinking of Willie Wallace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fifteen months the regiment remained at Edinburgh.&nbsp;
In the spring of 1814 the waning star of Napoleon had, to all
appearances, set, and he was on his way to his miniature kingdom,
the Isle of Elba (28th April).&nbsp; Europe commenced to disband
its huge armies, Great Britain among the rest.&nbsp; On 21st June
the West Norfolks received orders to proceed to Norwich by ship
<i>via</i> Leith and Great Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Government,
relieved of all apprehension of an invasion, had time to think of
the personal comfort of the country&rsquo;s defenders.&nbsp; With
marked consideration, the orders provided that those who wished
might march instead of embarking on the sea.&nbsp; Accordingly
Captain Borrow and his family chose the land route.&nbsp; Arrived
at Norwich, the regiment was formally disbanded amid great
festivity.&nbsp; The officers, at the Maid&rsquo;s Head, the
queen of East Anglian inns, and the men in the spacious
market-place, drank to the king&rsquo;s health and peace.&nbsp;
The regiment was formally mustered out on 19th July.</p>
<p>The Borrows took up their quarters at the Crown and Angel in
St Stephen&rsquo;s Street, a thoroughfare that connects the main
roads from Ipswich and Newmarket with the city.&nbsp; George, now
eleven years old, had an opportunity of continuing his education
at the Norwich Grammar School, whilst his brother proceeded to
study drawing and painting with a &ldquo;little dark man with
brown coat . . . and top-boots, whose name will one day be
considered the chief ornament of the old town,&rdquo; <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> and whose works are to &ldquo;rank
among the proudest pictures of England,&rdquo;&mdash;the Norwich
painter, &ldquo;Old Crome.&rdquo; <a name="citation15b"></a><a
href="#footnote15b" class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>Whilst the two boys were thus occupied, Louis XVIII. was
endeavouring to reorder his kingdom, and on a little island in
the Mediterranean, Napoleon was preparing a bombshell that was to
shatter the peace of Europe and send Captain Borrow hurrying
hither and thither in search of the men who, a few months before,
had left the colours, convinced that a generation of peace was
before them.</p>
<p>On 1st March Napoleon was at Cannes; eighteen days later Louis
XVIII. fled from Paris.&nbsp; Everywhere there were feverish
preparations for war.&nbsp; John Borrow threw aside pencil and
brush and was gazetted ensign in his father&rsquo;s regiment
(29th May).&nbsp; Europe united against the unexpected and
astonishing danger.&nbsp; By the time Captain Borrow had finished
his task, however, the crisis was past, Waterloo had been won and
Napoleon was on his way to St Helena.</p>
<p>By a happy inspiration it was decided to send the West
Norfolks to Ireland, where &ldquo;disturbances were
apprehended&rdquo; and private stills flourished.&nbsp; On 31st
August the regiment, some eight hundred strong, sailed in two
vessels from Harwich for Cork, the passage occupying eight
days.&nbsp; The ship that carried the Borrows was old and crazy,
constantly missing stays and shipping seas, until it seemed that
only by a miracle she escaped &ldquo;from being dashed upon the
foreland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few days&rsquo; rest at Cork, the &ldquo;city of
contradictions,&rdquo; where wealth and filth jostled one another
in the public highways and &ldquo;boisterous shouts of laughter
were heard on every side,&rdquo; the regiment marched off in two
divisions for Clonmel in Tipperary.&nbsp; Walking beside his
father, who was in command of the second division, and holding on
to his stirrup-leather, George found a new country opening out
before him.&nbsp; On one occasion, as they were passing through a
village of low huts, &ldquo;that seemed to be inhabited solely by
women and children,&rdquo; he went up to an old beldam who sat
spinning at the door of one of the hovels and asked for some
water.&nbsp; She &ldquo;appeared to consider for a moment, then
tottering into her hut, presently reappeared with a small pipkin
of milk, which she offered . . . with a trembling
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the lad tendered payment she declined the
money, and patted his face, murmuring some unintelligible
words.&nbsp; Obviously there was nothing in the boy&rsquo;s
nature now that appeared strange to simple-minded folk.&nbsp;
Probably the intercourse with other boys at Edinburgh and Norwich
had been beneficial in its effect.&nbsp; Keenly interested in
everything around him, George fell to speculating as to whether
he could learn Irish and speak to the people in their own
tongue.</p>
<p>At Clonmel the Borrows lodged with an Orangeman, who had run
out of his house as the Adjutant rode by at the head of his men,
and proceeded to welcome him with flowery volubility.&nbsp; On
the advice of his host Captain Borrow sent George to a Protestant
school, where he met the Irish boy Murtagh, who figures so
largely in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp;
Murtagh settled any doubts that Borrow may have had as to his
ability to acquire Erse, by teaching it to him in exchange for a
pack of cards.</p>
<p>On 23rd December 1815 Ensign John Thomas Borrow was promoted
to the rank of lieutenant, he being then in his sixteenth
year.&nbsp; In the following January, after only a few
months&rsquo; stay, the West Norfolks were moved on to
Templemore.&nbsp; It was here that George learned to ride, and
that without a saddle, and had awakened in him that
&ldquo;passion for the equine race&rdquo; that never left him. <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>The nine months spent in Ireland left an indelible mark upon
Borrow&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; In later life he repeatedly
referred to his knowledge of the country, its people, and their
language.&nbsp; In overcoming the difficulties of Erse, he had
opened up for himself a larger prospect than was to be enjoyed by
a traveller whose first word of greeting or enquiry is uttered in
a hated tongue.</p>
<p>On 11th May 1816 the West Norfolk Militia was back again at
Norwich.&nbsp; Peace was now finally restored to Europe, and
every nation was far too impoverished, both as regards men and
money, to nourish any schemes of aggression.&nbsp; Napoleon was
safe at St Helena, under the eye of that instinctive gaoler, Sir
Hudson Lowe.&nbsp; The army had completed its work and was being
disbanded with all possible speed.&nbsp; The turn of the West
Norfolk Militia came on 17th June, when they were formally
mustered out for the second time within two years.&nbsp; Three
years later their Adjutant was retired upon full-pay&mdash;eight
shillings a day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II:<br />
MAY 1816&ndash;MARCH 1824</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first time since his
marriage, Captain Borrow found himself at liberty to settle down
and educate his sons.&nbsp; He had spent much of his life in
Norfolk, and he decided to remain there and make Norwich his
home.&nbsp; It was a quiet and beautiful old-world city: healthy,
picturesque, ancient, and, above all, possessed of a Grammar
School, where George could try and gather together the stray
threads of education that he had acquired at various times and in
various dialects.&nbsp; It was an ideal city for a warrior to
take his rest in; but probably what counted most with Captain
Borrow was the Grammar School&mdash;more than the Norman
Cathedral, the grim old Castle that stands guardian-like upon its
mound, the fact of its being a garrison town, or even the
traditions that surrounded the place.&nbsp; He had two sons who
must be appropriately sent out into the world, and Norwich
offered facilities for educating both.&nbsp; He accordingly took
a small house in Willow Lane, to which access was obtained by a
covered passage then called King&rsquo;s, but now Borrow&rsquo;s
Court.</p>
<p>During the most nomadic portion of his life, when, with
discouraging rapidity, he was moving from place to place, Captain
Borrow never for one moment seems to have forgotten his
obligations as a father.&nbsp; Whenever he had been quartered in
a town for a few months, he had sought out a school to which to
send John and George, notably at Huddersfield and
Sheffield.&nbsp; Had he known it, these precautions were
unnecessary; for he had two sons who were of what may be called
the self-educating type: John, by virtue of the quickness of his
parts; George, on account of the strangeness of his interests and
his thirst for a knowledge of men and the tongues in which they
communicate to each other their ideas.&nbsp; It would be
impossible for an unconventional linguist, such as George Borrow
was by instinct, to remain uneducated, and it was equally
impossible to educate him.</p>
<p>Quite unaware of the trend of his younger son&rsquo;s genius,
Captain Borrow obtained for him a free-scholarship at the Grammar
School, then under the headmastership of the Rev. Edward Valpy,
B.D., whose principal claims to fame are his severity, his having
flogged the conqueror of the &ldquo;Flaming Tinman,&rdquo; and
his destruction of the School Records of Admission, which dated
back to the Sixteenth Century.&nbsp; Among Borrow&rsquo;s
contemporaries at the Grammar School were &ldquo;Rajah&rdquo;
Brooke of Sarawak (for whose achievements he in after life
expressed a profound admiration), Sir Archdale Wilson of Delhi,
Colonel Charles Stoddart, Dr James Martineau, and Thomas Borrow
Burcham, the London Magistrate.</p>
<p>Borrow was now thirteen, and, it would appear, as determined
as ever to evade as much as possible academic learning.&nbsp; He
was &ldquo;far from an industrious boy, fond of idling, and
discovered no symptoms by his progress either in Latin or Greek
of that philology, so prominent a feature of his last work
(<i>Lavengro</i>).&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; Borrow was an
idler merely because his work was uncongenial to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mere idleness is the most disagreeable state of existence,
and both mind and body are continually making efforts to escape
from it,&rdquo; he wrote in later years concerning this
period.&nbsp; He wanted an object in life, an occupation that
would prove not wholly uncongenial.&nbsp; That he should dislike
the routine of school life was not unnatural; for he had lived
quite free from those conventional restraints to which other boys
of his age had always been accustomed.&nbsp; Occupation of some
sort he must have, if only to keep at a distance that insistent
melancholy that seems to have been for ever hovering about him,
and the tempter whispered &ldquo;Languages.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; One day chance led him to a
bookstall whereon lay a polyglot dictionary, &ldquo;which
pretended to be an easy guide to the acquirement of French,
Italian, Low Dutch, and English.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took the two
first, and when he had gleaned from the old volume all it had to
teach him, he longed for a master.&nbsp; Him he found in the
person of an old French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> priest, <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a> a study in snuff-colour and drab with
a frill of dubious whiteness, who attended to the accents of a
number of boarding-school young ladies.&nbsp; The progress of his
pupil so much pleased the old priest that &ldquo;after six
months&rsquo; tuition, the master would sometimes, on his
occasional absences to teach in the country, request his so
forward pupil to attend for him his home scholars.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21c"></a><a href="#footnote21c"
class="citation">[21c]</a>&nbsp; It was M. D&rsquo;Eterville who
uttered the second recorded prophecy concerning George Borrow:
&ldquo;Vous serez un jour un grand philologue, mon cher,&rdquo;
he remarked, and heard that his pupil nourished aspirations
towards other things than mere philology.</p>
<p>In the study of French, Spanish, and Italian, Borrow spent
many hours that other boys would have devoted to pleasure; yet he
was by no means a student only.&nbsp; He found time to fish and
to shoot, using a condemned, honey-combed musket that bore the
date of 1746.&nbsp; His fishing was done in the river Yare, which
flowed through the estate of John Joseph Gurney, the
Quaker-banker of Earlham Hall, two miles out of Norwich.&nbsp; It
was here that he was reproached by the voice, &ldquo;clear and
sonorous as a bell,&rdquo; of the banker himself; not for
trespassing, but &ldquo;for pulling all those fish out of the
water, and leaving them to gasp in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Harford Bridge, some two miles along the Ipswich Road,
lived &ldquo;the terrible Thurtell,&rdquo; a patron and companion
of &ldquo;the bruisers of England,&rdquo; who taught Borrow to
box, and who ultimately ended his own inglorious career by being
hanged (9th January 1824) for the murder of Mr Weare, and
incidentally figuring in De Quincey&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Murder
Considered As One of the Fine Arts.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was through
&ldquo;the king of flash-men&rdquo; that Borrow saw his first
prize-fight at Eaton, near Norwich.</p>
<p>The passion for horses that came suddenly to Borrow with his
first ride upon the cob in Ireland had continued to grow.&nbsp;
He had an opportunity of gratifying it at the Norwich Horse Fair,
held each Easter under the shadow of the Castle, and famous
throughout the country. <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; It was here,
in 1818, that Borrow encountered again Ambrose Petulengro, an
event that was to exercise a considerable influence upon his
life.&nbsp; Mr Petulengro had become the head of his tribe, his
father and mother having been transported for passing bad
money.&nbsp; He was now a man, with a wife, a child, and also a
mother-in-law, who took a violent dislike to the tall,
fair-haired <i>gorgio</i>.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s life was much
broadened by his intercourse with Mr Petulengro.&nbsp; He was
often at the gypsy encampment on Mousehold, a heath just outside
Norwich, where, under the tuition of his host, he learned the
Romany tongue with such rapidity as to astonish his instructor
and earn for him among the gypsies the name of
&ldquo;Lav-engro,&rdquo; word-fellow or word-master.&nbsp; He
also boxed with the godlike Tawno Chikno, who in turn pronounced
him worthy to bear the name &ldquo;Cooro-mengro,&rdquo;
fist-fellow or fist-master.&nbsp; He frequently accompanied Mr
Petulengro to neighbouring fairs and markets, riding one of the
gypsy&rsquo;s horses.&nbsp; At other times the two would roam
over the gorse-covered Mousehold, discoursing largely about
things Romany.</p>
<p>The departure of Mr Petulengro and his retinue from Norwich
threw Borrow back once more upon his linguistic studies, his
fishing, his shooting, and his smouldering discontent at the
constraints of school life.&nbsp; It was probably an endeavour on
Borrow&rsquo;s part to make himself more like his gypsy friends
that prompted him to stain his face with walnut juice, drawing
from the Rev. Edward Valpy the question: &ldquo;Borrow, are you
suffering from jaundice, or is it only dirt?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
gypsies were not the only vagabonds of Borrow&rsquo;s
acquaintance at this period.&nbsp; There were the Italian
peripatetic vendors of weather-glasses, who had their
headquarters at Norwich.&nbsp; In after years he met again more
than one of these merchants.&nbsp; They were always glad to see
him and revive old memories of the Norwich days.</p>
<p>About this time he saved a boy from drowning in the Yare. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; It may be this act with which he
generously credits his brother John when he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have known him dash from a steep bank
into a stream in his full dress, and pull out a man who was
drowning; yet there were twenty others bathing in the water, who
might have saved him by putting out a hand, without inconvenience
to themselves, which, however, they did not do, but stared with
stupid surprise at the drowning one&rsquo;s struggles.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the first Borrow had shown a strong distaste for the
humdrum routine of school life.&nbsp; In a thousand ways he was
different from his fellows.&nbsp; He had been accustomed to meet
strange and, to him, deeply interesting people.&nbsp; Now he was
bidden adopt a course of life against which his whole nature
rebelled.&nbsp; It was impossible.&nbsp; He missed the atmosphere
of vagabondage that had inspired and stimulated his early
boyhood.</p>
<p>The crisis came at last.&nbsp; There was only one way to avoid
the awkward and distasteful destiny that was being forced upon
him.&nbsp; He entered into a conspiracy with three
school-fellows, all younger than himself, to make a dash for a
life that should offer wider opportunities to their adventurous
natures.&nbsp; The plan was to tramp to Great Yarmouth and there
excavate on the seashore caves for their habitation.&nbsp; From
these headquarters they would make foraging expeditions, and live
on what they could extract from the surrounding country, either
by force or by the terror that they inspired.&nbsp; One morning
the four started on their twenty-mile trudge to the sea; but,
when only a few miles out, one of their number became fearful and
turned back.</p>
<p>Encouraged by their leader, the others continued on their
way.&nbsp; The father of the other two boys appears to have got
wind of the project and posted after them in a chaise.&nbsp; He
came up with them at Acle, about eleven miles from Norwich.&nbsp;
When they were first seen, Borrow was striving to hearten his
fellow buccaneers, who were tired and dispirited after their long
walk.&nbsp; The three were unceremoniously bundled into the
chaise and returned to their homes and, subsequently, to the
wrath of the Rev. Edward Valpy. <a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a></p>
<p>The names of the three confederates were John Dalrymple (whose
heart failed him) and Theodosius and Francis Purland, sons of a
Norwich chemist.&nbsp; The Purlands are credited with robbing
&ldquo;the paternal till,&rdquo; while Dalrymple confined himself
to the less compromising duty of &ldquo;gathering horse-pistols
and potatoes.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the boys robbed their
father&rsquo;s till, why did they beg?&nbsp; In the ballad
entitled <i>The Wandering Children and the Benevolent
Gentleman</i>, Borrow depicts the &ldquo;eldest child&rdquo; as
begging for charity for these hungry children, who have had
&ldquo;no breakfast, save the haws.&rdquo;&nbsp; This does not
seem to suggest that the boys were in the possession of
money.&nbsp; Again, it was the father of one of their
schoolfellows who was responsible for their capture, according to
Dr Knapp, by asking them to dinner whilst he despatched a
messenger to the Rev. Edward Valpy.&nbsp; The story of
Borrow&rsquo;s being &ldquo;horsed&rdquo; on Dr Martineau&rsquo;s
back is apocryphal.&nbsp; Martineau himself denied it. <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a></p>
<p>There is no record of how Captain Borrow received the news of
his younger son&rsquo;s breach of discipline.&nbsp; It probably
reminded him that the boy was now fifteen and it was time to
think about his future.&nbsp; The old soldier was puzzled.&nbsp;
Not only had his second son shown a great partiality for
acquiring Continental tongues, but he had learned Irish, and
Captain Borrow seemed to think that by learning the language of
Papists and rebels, his son had sullied the family honour.&nbsp;
To his father&rsquo;s way of thinking, this accomplishment seemed
to bar him from most things that were at one and the same time
honourable and desirable.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s own inclinations pointed to the army; but
Captain Borrow had apparently seen too much of the army in war
time, and the slowness of promotion, to think of it as offering a
career suitable to his son, now that there was every prospect of
a prolonged peace.&nbsp; He thought of the church as an
alternative; but here again that fatal facility the boy had shown
in learning Erse seemed to stand out as a barrier.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have observed the poor lad attentively and really I do not see
what to make of him,&rdquo; Captain Borrow is said to have
remarked.&nbsp; What could be expected of a lad who would forsake
Greek for Irish, or Latin for the barbarous tongue of homeless
vagabonds?&nbsp; Certainly not a good churchman.&nbsp; At length
it became obvious to the distressed parents that there was only
one choice left them&mdash;the law.</p>
<p>About this period Borrow fell ill of some nameless and
unclassified disease, which defied the wisdom of physicians, who
shook their heads gravely by his bedside.&nbsp; An old woman,
however, cured him by a decoction prepared from a bitter
root.&nbsp; The convalescence was slow and laborious; for the
boy&rsquo;s nerves were shattered, and that deep, haunting
melancholy, which he first called the &ldquo;Fear&rdquo; and
afterwards the &ldquo;Horrors,&rdquo; descended upon him.</p>
<p>On the 30th of March 1819 Borrow was articled for five years
to Simpson &amp; Rackham, solicitors, of Tuck&rsquo;s Court, St
Giles, Norwich. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; He consequently left home to take
up his abode at the house of the senior partner in the Upper
Close. <a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; Mr William Simpson was a man of
considerable importance in the city; for besides being Treasurer
of the County, he was Chamberlain and Town Clerk, whilst his wife
was famed for her hospitality, in particular her expensive
dinners.</p>
<p>With that unerring instinct of contrariety that never seemed
to forsake him, Borrow proceeded to learn, not law but
Welsh.&nbsp; When the eyes of authority were on him he
transcribed Blackstone, but when they were turned away he read
and translated the poems of Ab Gwilym.&nbsp; He performed his
tasks &ldquo;as well as could be expected in one who was occupied
by so many and busy thoughts of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of Tuck&rsquo;s Court was a house at which was
employed a Welsh groom, a queer fellow who soon attracted the
notice of Simpson &amp; Rackham&rsquo;s clerks, young gentlemen
who were bent on &ldquo;mis-spending the time which was not
legally their own.&rdquo; <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a>&nbsp; They would
make audible remarks about the unfortunate and inoffensive Welsh
groom, calling out after him &ldquo;Taffy&rdquo;&mdash;in short,
rendering the poor fellow&rsquo;s life a misery with their jibes,
until at last, almost distracted, he had come to the
determination either to give his master notice or to hang
himself, that he might get away from that &ldquo;nest of
parcupines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow saw in the predicament of the
Welsh groom the hand of providence.&nbsp; He made a compact with
him, that in exchange for lessons in Welsh, he, Borrow, should
persuade his fellow clerks to cease their annoyance.</p>
<p>From that time, each Sunday afternoon, the Welsh groom would
go to Captain Borrow&rsquo;s house to instruct his son in Welsh
pronunciation; for in book Welsh Borrow was stronger than his
preceptor.&nbsp; Borrow had learned the language of the bards
&ldquo;chiefly by going through Owen Pugh&rsquo;s version of
&lsquo;Paradise Lost&rsquo; twice&rdquo; with the original by his
side.&nbsp; After which &ldquo;there was very little in Welsh
poetry that I could not make out with a little pondering.&rdquo;
<a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; This had occupied some three
years.&nbsp; The studies with the groom lasted for about twelve
months, until he left Norwich with his family. <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a></p>
<p>Captain Borrow&rsquo;s thoughts were frequently occupied with
the future of his younger son, a problem that had by no means
been determined by signing the articles that bound him to Simpson
&amp; Rackham.&nbsp; The boy was frank and honest and did not
scruple to give expression to ideas of his own, and it was these
ideas that alarmed his father.&nbsp; Once at the house of Mr
Simpson, and before the assembled guests, he told an archdeacon,
worth &pound;7000 a year, that the classics were much overvalued,
and compared Ab Gwilym with Ovid, to the detriment of the
Roman.&nbsp; To Captain Borrow the possession of ideas upon any
subject by one so young was in itself a thing to be deplored; but
to venture an opinion contrary to that commonly held by men of
weight and substance was an unforgivable act of
insubordination.</p>
<p>The boy had been sent to Tuck&rsquo;s Court to learn law, and
instead he persisted in acquiring languages, and such
languages!&nbsp; Welsh, Danish, Arabic, Armenian, Saxon; for
these were the tongues with which he occupied himself.&nbsp; None
but a perfect mother such as Mrs Borrow could have found excuses
for a son who pursued such studies, and her husband pointed out
to her, it is &ldquo;in the nature of women invariably to take
the part of the second born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of those curiously self-revelatory passages with which
his writings abound, Borrow tells how he continued to act as
door-keeper long after it had ceased to be part of his
duty.&nbsp; As a student of men and a collector of strange
characters, it was in keeping with his genius to do so, although
he himself was unable to explain why he took pleasure in the
task.&nbsp; No one was admitted to the presence of the senior
partner who did not first pass the searching scrutiny of his
articled clerk.&nbsp; Those who pleased him were admitted to Mr
Simpson&rsquo;s private room; to those who did not he proved
himself an almost insuperable obstacle.&nbsp; Unfortunately
Borrow&rsquo;s standards were those of the physiognomist rather
than the lawyer; he inverted the whole fabric of professional
desirability by admitting the goats and refusing the sheep.&nbsp;
He turned away a knight, or a baronet, and admitted a poet, until
at last the distressed old gentleman in black, with the
philanthropical head, his master, was forced to expostulate and
adjure his clerk to judge, not by faces but by clothes, which in
reality make the man.&nbsp; Borrow bowed to the ruling of
&ldquo;the prince of English solicitors,&rdquo; revised his
standards and continued to act as keeper of the door.</p>
<p>Mr Simpson seems to have earned Borrow&rsquo;s thorough
regard, no small achievement considering in how much he differed
from his illustrious articled-clerk in everything, not excepting
humour, of which the delightful, old-world gentleman seems to
have had a generous share.&nbsp; He was doubtless puzzled to
classify the strange being by whose instrumentality a stream of
undesirable people was admitted to his presence, whilst
distinguished clients were sternly and rigorously turned
away.&nbsp; He probably smiled at the story of the old yeoman and
his wife who, in return for some civility shown to them by
Borrow, presented him with an old volume of Danish ballads, which
inspired him to learn the language, aided by a Danish Bible. <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; He was not only &ldquo;the first
solicitor in East Anglia,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the prince of all
English solicitors&mdash;for he was a gentleman!&rdquo; <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a>&nbsp; In another place Borrow refers
to him as &ldquo;my old master . . . who would have died sooner
than broken his word.&nbsp; God bless him!&rdquo; <a
name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a>&nbsp; And yet again as &ldquo;my
ancient master, the gentleman solicitor of East Anglia.&rdquo; <a
name="citation30d"></a><a href="#footnote30d"
class="citation">[30d]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was always handsome in everything he did.&nbsp; If he
hated a man he hated him, his kith and kin and all who bore his
name.&nbsp; His friendship was similarly sweeping, and his regard
for William Simpson prompted him to write subsequently of the law
as &ldquo;a profession which abounds with honourable men, and in
which I believe there are fewer scamps than in any other.&nbsp;
The most honourable men I have ever known have been lawyers; they
were men whose word was their bond, and who would have preferred
ruin to breaking it.&rdquo; <a name="citation31a"></a><a
href="#footnote31a" class="citation">[31a]</a></p>
<p>Fortunately for Borrow there was at the Norwich Guildhall a
valuable library consisting of a large number of ancient folios
written in many languages.&nbsp; &ldquo;Amidst the dust and
cobwebs of the Corporation Library&rdquo; he studied earnestly
and, with a fine disregard for a librarian&rsquo;s feelings,
annotated some of the volumes, his marginalia existing to this
day.&nbsp; One of his favourite works was the <i>Danica
Literatura Antiquissima</i> of Olaus Wormius, 1636, which
inspired him with the idea of adopting the name Olaus, his
subsequent contributions to <i>The New Magazine</i> being signed
George Olaus Borrow.</p>
<p>Whilst Borrow was striving to learn languages and avoid the
law, <a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> the question of his brother&rsquo;s
career was seriously occupying the mind of their father.&nbsp;
Borrow loved and admired his brother.&nbsp; There is sincerity in
all he writes concerning John, and there is something of nobility
about the way in which he tells of his father&rsquo;s preference
for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;cannot excuse
the honest pride of the old man&mdash;the stout old man?&rdquo;
<a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a></p>
<p>The Peace had closed to John Borrow the army as a profession,
and he had devoted himself assiduously to his art.&nbsp; Under
Crome the elder he had made considerable progress, and had
exhibited a number of pictures at the yearly exhibitions of the
Norwich Society of Artists.&nbsp; He continued to study with
Crome until the artist&rsquo;s death (22nd April 1821), when a
new master had to be sought.&nbsp; With his father&rsquo;s
blessing and &pound;150 he proceeded to London, where he remained
for more than a year studying with B. R. Haydon. <a
name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; Later he went to Paris to copy
Old Masters.</p>
<p>About this time Borrow had an opportunity of seeing many of
&ldquo;the bruisers of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his veins flowed
the blood of the man who had met Big Ben Bryan and survived the
encounter undefeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let no one sneer at the
bruisers of England,&rdquo; Borrow wrote&mdash;&ldquo;What were
the gladiators of Rome, or the bull-fighters of Spain, in its
palmiest days, compared to England&rsquo;s bruisers?&rdquo; <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a> he asks.&nbsp; On 17th July 1820
Edward Painter of Norwich was to meet Thomas Oliver of London for
a purse of a hundred guineas.&nbsp; On the Saturday previous (the
15th) the Norwich hotels began to fill with bruisers and their
patrons, and men went their ways anxiously polite to the
stranger, lest he turn out to be some champion whom it were
dangerous to affront.&nbsp; Thomas Cribb, the champion of
England, had come to see the fight, &ldquo;Teucer Belcher, savage
Shelton, . . . the terrible Randall, . . . Bulldog Hudson, . . .
fearless Scroggins, . . . Black Richmond, . . . Tom of
Bedford,&rdquo; and a host of lesser lights of the
&ldquo;Fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Monday, upwards of 20,000 men swept out of the old city
towards North Walsham, less than twenty miles distant, among them
George Borrow, striding along among the varied stream of men and
vehicles (some 2000 in number) to see the great fight, which was
to end in the victory of the local man and a terrible storm, as
if heaven were thundering its anger against a brutal
spectacle.&nbsp; The sportsmen were left to find their way to
shelter, Borrow and Mr Petulengro, whom he had encountered just
after the fight, with them, talking of dukkeripens
(fortunes).</p>
<p>Some time during the year 1820, a Jew named Levy (the Mousha
of <i>Lavengro</i>), Borrow&rsquo;s instructor in Hebrew,
introduced him to William Taylor, <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a> one of the most
extraordinary men that Norwich ever produced.&nbsp; In the
long-limbed young lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, whose hair was rapidly
becoming grey, Taylor showed great interest, and, as an act of
friendship, undertook to teach him German.&nbsp; He was gratified
by the young man&rsquo;s astonishing progress, and much
interested in his remarkable personality.&nbsp; As a result
Borrow became a frequent visitor at 21 King Street, Norwich,
where Taylor lived and many strange men assembled.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if William Taylor ever found another pupil so
apt, or a disciple so enthusiastic among all the
&ldquo;harum-scarum young men&rdquo; <a name="citation33b"></a><a
href="#footnote33b" class="citation">[33b]</a> that he was so
fond of taking up and introducing &ldquo;into the best society
the place afforded.&rdquo; <a name="citation33c"></a><a
href="#footnote33c" class="citation">[33c]</a>&nbsp; He was much
impressed by Borrow&rsquo;s extraordinary memory and power of
concentration.&nbsp; Speaking one day of the different degrees of
intelligence in men he said:&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot give you a
better example to explain my meaning than my two pupils (there
was another named Cooke, who was said to be &lsquo;a genius in
his way&rsquo;); what I tell Borrow once he ever remembers;
whilst to the fellow Cooke I have to repeat the same thing twenty
times, often without effect; and it is not from want of memory
either, but he will never be a linguist.&rdquo; <a
name="citation33d"></a><a href="#footnote33d"
class="citation">[33d]</a></p>
<p>To a correspondent Taylor wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Norwich young man is construing with me
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Wilhelm Tell</i>, with the view of
translating it for the press.&nbsp; His name is George Henry
Borrow, and he has learnt German with extraordinary rapidity;
indeed, he has the gift of tongues, and, though not yet eighteen,
understands twelve languages&mdash;English, Welsh, Erse, Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, German, Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese; he would like to get into the Office for Foreign
Affairs, but does not know how.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was in 1821; two years later Borrow is said to have
&ldquo;translated with fidelity and elegance from twenty
different languages.&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; In spite of
his later achievements in learning languages, it seems scarcely
credible that he acquired eight separate languages in two years,
although it must be remembered that with him the learning of a
language was to be able to read it after a rather laborious
fashion.&nbsp; Taylor, however, uses the words &ldquo;facility
and elegance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the autobiographical notes that Borrow supplied to Mr John
Longe in 1862 there appears the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the expiration of his clerkship he knew
little of the law, but he was well versed in languages, being not
only a good Greek and Latin scholar, but acquainted with French,
Italian, Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic dialects, and
likewise with the peculiar language of the English Romany Chals
or gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At William Taylor&rsquo;s table Borrow met &ldquo;the most
intellectual and talented men of Norwich, as also those of note
who visited the city.&rdquo; <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a>&nbsp; Taylor was
much interested in young men, into whose minds he did not
hesitate to instil his own ideas, ideas that not only earned for
him the name of &ldquo;Godless Billy,&rdquo; but outraged his
respectable fellow-citizens as much as did his intemperate
habits.&nbsp; &ldquo;His face was terribly bloated from drink,
and he had a look as if his intellect was almost as much decayed
as his body,&rdquo; wrote a contemporary. <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Matters grew worse in his
old age,&rdquo; says Harriet Martineau, &ldquo;when his habits of
intemperance kept him out of the sight of ladies, and he got
round him a set of ignorant and conceited young men, who thought
they could set the whole world right by their destructive
propensities.&nbsp; One of his chief favourites was George
Borrow.&rdquo; <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a>&nbsp; Borrow has given the following
convincing picture of Taylor:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Methought I was in a small, comfortable
room wainscotted with oak; I was seated on one side of a
fireplace, close by a table on which were wine and fruit; on the
other side of the fire sat a man in a plain suit of brown, with
the hair combed back from the somewhat high forehead; he had a
pipe in his mouth, which for some time he smoked gravely and
placidly, without saying a word; at length, after drawing at the
pipe for some time rather vigorously, he removed it from his
mouth, and emitting an accumulated cloud of smoke, he exclaimed
in a slow and measured tone: &lsquo;As I was telling you just
now, my good chap, I have always been an enemy of
humbug.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation35c"></a><a
href="#footnote35c" class="citation">[35c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Taylor appears to have flattered &ldquo;the
harum-scarum young men&rdquo; with whom he surrounded himself by
talking to them as if they were his intellectual equals.&nbsp; He
encouraged them to form their own opinions, in itself a thing
scarcely likely to make him popular with either parents or
guardians, least of all with discipline-loving Captain Borrow,
who declined even to return the salute of his son&rsquo;s friend
on the public highway.</p>
<p>Borrow now began to look to the future and speculate as to
what his present life would lead to.&nbsp; His cogitations seem
to have ended, almost invariably, in a gloomy mist of pessimism
and despair&mdash;in other words, an attack of the
&ldquo;Horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Mr Petulengro were encamped upon
Mousehold, the antidote lay near to hand in his friend&rsquo;s
pagan optimism; if, on the other hand, the tents of Egypt were
pitched on other soil, there was no remedy, unless perhaps a
prize-fight supplied the necessary stimulus to divert his
thoughts from their melancholy trend.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Borrow met at the house of his tutor and friend, in July 1821,
Dr Bowring <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> (afterwards Sir John) at a dinner
given in his honour.&nbsp; Bowring had recently published
<i>Specimen of Russian Poets</i>, in recognition of which the
Czar (Alexander I.) had presented him with a diamond ring.&nbsp;
He had a considerable reputation as a linguist, which naturally
attracted Borrow to him.&nbsp; Dr Bowring was told of
Borrow&rsquo;s accomplishments, and during the evening took a
seat beside him.&nbsp; Borrow confessed to being &ldquo;a little
frightened at first&rdquo; of the distinguished man, whom he
described as having &ldquo;a thin weaselly figure, a sallow
complexion, a certain obliquity of vision, and a large pair of
spectacles.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be dangerous to accept entirely
the account that Borrow gives of the meeting, <a
name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a> because when that was written he had
come to hate and despise the man whom he had begun by regarding
with such awe.&nbsp; Bowring appears to have ventilated his views
with some freedom, and to have had a rather serious passage of
arms with another guest whom he had rudely contradicted.&nbsp; It
is very probable that Borrow&rsquo;s dislike of Bowring prompted
him to exaggerate his account of what happened at Taylor&rsquo;s
house that evening.</p>
<p>Whilst Borrow was industriously occupied in collecting
vagabonds and imbibing the dangerous beliefs of William Taylor,
there sat in an easy-chair in the small front-parlour of the
little house in Willow Lane, in a faded regimental coat, a
prematurely old man, whose frame still showed signs of the
magnificent physique of his vigorous manhood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes in prayer, sometimes in meditation, and
sometimes in reading the Scriptures,&rdquo; with his dog beside
him, Captain Thomas Borrow, now sixty-five, was preparing for the
end that he felt to be approaching.&nbsp; He frequently meditated
upon what was to become of his younger son George, who held his
father in such awe as to feel ill at ease when alone with
him.</p>
<p>One day the inevitable interrogation took place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you propose to do?&rdquo; and the equally
inevitable reply followed, &ldquo;I really do not know what I
shall do.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of a somewhat lengthy
cross-examination, Captain Borrow discovered that his son knew
the Armenian tongue, for which he very cunningly strove to enlist
his father&rsquo;s interest by telling him that in Armenia was
Mount Ararat, whereon the ark rested.&nbsp; Captain Borrow also
discovered that his son could not only shoe a horse, but also
make the shoes; but, what was most important, he found that
George had learned &ldquo;very little&rdquo; law.&nbsp; When
asked if he thought he could support himself by Armenian or his
&ldquo;other acquirements,&rdquo; the younger man was not very
hopeful, and horrified the old soldier by suggesting that if all
else failed there was always suicide.</p>
<p>The dying man was thus left to yearn for the return of his
elder son, in whom all his hopes lay centred.&nbsp; John appears
to have been by no means dutiful to his parents in the matter of
letters.&nbsp; For six months he left them unacquainted even with
his address in Paris, where he was still copying Old Masters in
the Louvre.</p>
<p>After their talk the father and younger son seem to have come
to a better understanding.&nbsp; George would frequently read
aloud from the Bible, whilst Captain Borrow would tell about his
early life.&nbsp; His son &ldquo;had no idea that he knew and had
seen so much; my respect for him increased, and I looked upon him
almost with admiration.&nbsp; His anecdotes were in general
highly curious; some of them related to people in the highest
stations, and to men whose names are closely connected with some
of the brightest glories of our native land.&rdquo; <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>At last John arrived, apparently a little disillusioned with
the world; but the coming of his favourite son produced no change
for the better in Captain Borrow&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; He was
content and happy that God had granted his wish.&nbsp; There
remained nothing now to do but &ldquo;to bless my little family
and go.&rdquo;&nbsp; George learned &ldquo;that it is possible to
feel deeply and yet make no outward sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end came on the morning of 28th February 1824.&nbsp; It
was by a strange chance that the old man should die in the arms
of his younger son, who had run down on hearing his
mother&rsquo;s anguished screams.&nbsp; Borrow has given a
dramatic account of his father&rsquo;s last moments:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the dead hour of night, it might be
about two, I was awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from
the room immediately below that in which I slept.&nbsp; I knew
the cry, it was the cry of my mother, and I also knew its import;
yet I made no effort to rise, for I was for the moment
paralysed.&nbsp; Again the cry sounded, yet still I lay
motionless&mdash;the stupidity of horror was upon me.&nbsp; A
third time, and it was then that, by a violent effort bursting
the spell which appeared to bind me, I sprang from the bed and
rushed downstairs.&nbsp; My mother was running wildly about the
room; she had awoke and found my father senseless in the bed by
her side.&nbsp; I essayed to raise him, and after a few efforts
supported him in the bed in a sitting posture.&nbsp; My brother
now rushed in, and snatching a light that was burning, he held it
to my father&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &lsquo;The surgeon, the
surgeon!&rsquo; he cried; then dropping the light, he ran out of
the room followed by my mother; I remained alone, supporting the
senseless form of my father; the light had been extinguished by
the fall, and an almost total darkness reigned in the room.&nbsp;
The form pressed heavily against my bosom&mdash;at last methought
it moved.&nbsp; Yes, I was right, there was a heaving of the
breast, and then a gasping.&nbsp; Were those words which I
heard?&nbsp; Yes, they were words, low and indistinct at first,
and then audible.&nbsp; The mind of the dying man was reverting
to former scenes.&nbsp; I heard him mention names which I had
often heard him mention before.&nbsp; It was an awful moment; I
felt stupified, but I still contrived to support my dying
father.&nbsp; There was a pause, again my father spoke: I heard
him speak of Minden, and of Meredith, the old Minden sergeant,
and then he uttered another name, which at one period of his life
was much on his lips, the name of&mdash;but this is a solemn
moment!&nbsp; There was a deep gasp: I shook, and thought all was
over; but I was mistaken&mdash;my father moved and revived for a
moment; he supported himself in bed without my assistance.&nbsp;
I make no doubt that for a moment he was perfectly sensible, and
it was then that, clasping his hands, he uttered another name
clearly, distinctly&mdash;it was the name of Christ.&nbsp; With
that name upon his lips, the brave old soldier sank back upon my
bosom, and, with his hands still clasped, yielded up his
soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
APRIL 1824&ndash;MAY 1825</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> 2nd April 1824, George Borrow
was cast upon the world of London by the death of his father,
&ldquo;with an exterior shy and cold, under which lurk much
curiosity, especially with regard to what is wild and
extraordinary, a considerable quantity of energy and industry,
and an unconquerable love of independence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a></p>
<p>It had become necessary for him to earn his own
livelihood.&nbsp; Captain Borrow&rsquo;s pension had ceased with
his death, and the old soldier&rsquo;s savings of a lifetime were
barely sufficient to produce an income of a hundred pounds a year
for his widow.&nbsp; The provision made in the will for his
younger son during his minority would operate only for about four
months, as he would be of age in the following July. <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; The clerkship with Simpson &amp;
Rackham would expire at the end of March.&nbsp; Borrow had
outlined his ambitions in a letter written on 20th January 1824,
when he was ill and wretched, to Roger Kerrison, then in London:
&ldquo;If ever my health mends [this has reference to a very
unpleasant complaint he had contracted], and possibly it may by
the time my clerkship is expired, I intend to live in London,
write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion and get myself
prosecuted,&rdquo; for he was tired of the &ldquo;dull and gloomy
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was therefore with a feeling of relief
that, on the evening of 1st April, he took his seat on the top of
the London coach, his hopes centred in a small green box that he
carried with him.&nbsp; It contained his stock-in-trade as an
author: his beloved manuscripts, &ldquo;closely written over in a
singular hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the bundles of papers were:</p>
<p class="gutindent">(i.)&nbsp; The Ancient Songs of Denmark,
heroic and romantic, translated by himself, with notes
philological, critical and historical.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(ii.)&nbsp; The Songs of Ab Gwilym, the
Welsh Bard, also translated by himself, with notes critical,
philological and historical. <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a></p>
<p class="gutindent">(iii.)&nbsp; A romance in the German
style.</p>
<p>In addition to his manuscripts, Borrow had some twenty or
thirty pounds, his testimonials, and a letter from William Taylor
to Sir Richard Phillips, the publisher, to whose <i>New
Magazine</i> he had already contributed a number of translations
of poems.&nbsp; He had also printed in <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i> and <i>The New Monthly Magazine</i> translations of
verse from the German, Swedish, Dutch, Danish and Spanish, and an
essay on Danish ballad writing.</p>
<p>On the morning of 2nd April there arrived at 16 Milman Street,
Bedford Row, London, W.C.,</p>

<p>It was through the Kerrisons that Borrow went to 16 Milman
Street, where Roger was lodging.&nbsp; His apartments seem to
have been dismal enough, consisting of &ldquo;a small room, up
two pair of stairs, in which I was to sit, and another, still
smaller, above it, in which I was to sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
the first feeling of loneliness had passed, dispelled largely by
a bright fire and breakfast, he sallied forth, the contents of
the green box under his arm, to present his letter of
introduction to Sir Richard Phillips, <a
name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> in whom centred his hopes of
employment.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On arriving at the publisher&rsquo;s house in Tavistock
Square, he was immediately shown into Sir Richard&rsquo;s study,
where he found &ldquo;a tall, stout man, about sixty, dressed in
a loose morning gown,&rdquo; and with him his confidential clerk
Bartlett (the Taggart of <i>Lavengro</i>).&nbsp; Sir Richard was
at first enthusiastic and cordial, but when he learned from
William Taylor&rsquo;s letter that Borrow had come up to earn his
livelihood by authorship, his manner underwent a marked
change.&nbsp; The bluff, hearty expression gave place to &ldquo;a
sinister glance,&rdquo; and Borrow found that within that loose
morning gown there was a second Sir Richard.</p>
<p>He learned two things&mdash;first, that Sir Richard Phillips
had retired from publishing and had reserved only <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>; <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> secondly, that literature was a drug
upon the market.&nbsp; With airy self-assertiveness, the
ex-publisher dismissed the contents of the green box that Borrow
had brought with him, which had already aroused considerable
suspicion in the mind of the maid who had admitted him to the
publisher&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>When he had thoroughly dashed the young author&rsquo;s hopes
of employment, Sir Richard informed him of a new publication he
had in preparation, <i>The Universal Review</i> [<i>The Oxford
Review</i> of <i>Lavengro</i>], which was to support the son of
the house and the wife he had married.&nbsp; With a promise that
he should become a contributor to the new review, an earnest
exhortation to write a story in the style of <i>The
Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, and an invitation to dinner for
the following Sunday, the first interview between George Borrow
and Sir Richard Phillips ended, and Borrow left the great
man&rsquo;s presence to begin his exploration of London, first
leaving his manuscripts at Milman Street.&nbsp; During the rest
of the day he walked &ldquo;scarcely less than thirty miles about
the big city.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was late when he returned to his
lodgings, thoroughly tired, but with a copy of <i>The
Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, for &ldquo;a well-written tale in
the style&rdquo; of which Sir Richard Phillips &ldquo;could
afford as much as ten pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day had been one
of the most eventful in Borrow&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday Borrow dined at Tavistock Square, and
met Lady Phillips, young Phillips and his bride.&nbsp; He learned
that Sir Richard was a vegetarian of twenty years&rsquo; standing
and a total abstainer, although meat and wine were not banished
from his table.&nbsp; When publisher and potential author were
left alone, the son having soon followed the ladies into the
drawing-room, Borrow heard of Sir Richard&rsquo;s amiable
intentions towards him.&nbsp; He was to compile six volumes of
the lives and trials of criminals [the <i>Newgate Lives and
Trials</i> of <i>Lavengro</i>], each to contain not less than a
thousand pages. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; For this work he was to receive
the munificent sum of fifty pounds, which was to cover all
expenses incurred in the purchase of books, papers and
manuscripts necessary to the compilation of the work.&nbsp; This
was only one of the employments that the fertile brain of the
publisher had schemed for him.&nbsp; He was also to make himself
useful in connection with the forthcoming <i>Universal
Review</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Generally useful, sir&mdash;doing
whatever is required of you&rdquo;; for it was not Sir
Richard&rsquo;s custom to allow young writers to select their own
subjects.</p>
<p>With impressive manner and ponderous diction, Sir Richard
Phillips unfolded his philanthropic designs regarding the young
writer to whom his words meant a career.&nbsp; He did not end
with the appointment of Borrow as general utility writer upon
<i>The Universal Review</i>; but proceeded to astonish him with
the announcement that to him, George Borrow, understanding German
in a manner that aroused the &ldquo;strong admiration&rdquo; of
William Taylor, was to be entrusted the translating into that
tongue of Sir Richard Phillips&rsquo; book of Philosophy. <a
name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; If translations of Goethe into
English were a drug, Sir Richard Phillips&rsquo; <i>Proximate
Causes</i> was to prove that neither he nor his book would be a
drug in Germany.&nbsp; For this work the remuneration was to be
determined by the success of the translation, an arrangement
sufficiently vague to ensure eventual disagreement.</p>
<p>When Sir Richard had finished his account of what were his
intentions towards his guest, he gave him to understand that the
interview was at an end, at the same time intimating how seldom
it was that he dealt so generously with a young writer.&nbsp;
Borrow then rose from the table and passed out of the house,
leaving his host to muse, as was his custom on Sunday afternoons,
&ldquo;on the magnificence of nature and the moral dignity of
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next few weeks Borrow was occupied in searching in
out-of-the-way corners for criminal biography.&nbsp; If he
flagged, a visit from his philosopher-publisher spurred him on to
fresh effort.&nbsp; He received a copy of <i>Proximate
Causes</i>, with an injunction that he should review it in <i>The
Universal Review</i>, as well as translate it into German.&nbsp;
He was taken to and introduced to the working editor <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a> of the new publication, which was only
ostensibly under the control of young Phillips.</p>
<p>In the provision that he should purchase at his own expense
all the necessary materials for <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, Borrow
found a serious tax upon his resources; but a harder thing to
bear with patience and good-humour were the frequent visits he
received from Sir Richard himself, who showed the keenest
possible interest in the progress of the compilation.&nbsp; He
had already caused a preliminary announcement to be made <a
name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b"
class="citation">[45b]</a> to the effect that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Selection of the most remarkable Trials
and Criminal Causes is printing, in five volumes. <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; It will include all famous
cases, from that of Lord Cobham, in the reign of Henry the Fifth,
to that of John Thurtell: and those connected with foreign as
well as English jurisprudence.&nbsp; Mr Borrow, the editor, has
availed himself of all the resources of the English, German,
French, and Italian languages; and his work, including from 150
to 200 <a name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a> of the most interesting cases on
record, will appear in October next.&rdquo; <a
name="citation46c"></a><a href="#footnote46c"
class="citation">[46c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Richard&rsquo;s visits to Milman Street were always
accompanied by numerous suggestions as to criminals whose claims
to be included in this literary chamber of horrors were in his,
Sir Richard&rsquo;s, opinion unquestionable.&nbsp; The English
character of the compilation was soon sacrificed in order to
admit notable malefactors of other nationalities, and the drain
upon the editor&rsquo;s small capital became greater than
ever.</p>
<p>The leisure that he allowed himself, Borrow spent in exploring
the city, or in the company of Francis Arden (Ardrey in
<i>Lavengro</i>), whom he had met by chance in the coffee-room of
a hotel.&nbsp; The two appear to have been excellent friends,
perhaps because of the dissimilarity of their natures.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was an Irishman,&rdquo; Borrow explains, &ldquo;I an
Englishman; he fiery, enthusiastic and opened-hearted; I neither
fiery, enthusiastic, nor open-hearted; he fond of pleasure and
dissipation, I of study and reflection.&rdquo; <a
name="citation46d"></a><a href="#footnote46d"
class="citation">[46d]</a></p>
<p>They went to the play together, to dog-fights, gaming-houses,
in short saw the sights of London.&nbsp; The arrival of Francis
Arden at 16 Milman Street was a signal for books and manuscripts
to be thrown aside in favour either of some expedition or an hour
or two&rsquo;s conversation.&nbsp; Borrow, however, soon tired of
the pleasures of London, and devoted himself almost entirely to
work.&nbsp; Although he saw less of Francis Arden in consequence,
they continued to be excellent friends.</p>
<p>After being some four weeks in London, Borrow received a
surprise visit (29th April) from his brother, whom he found
waiting for him one morning when he came down to breakfast.&nbsp;
John told him of his mother&rsquo;s anxiety at receiving only one
letter from him since his departure, of her fits of crying, of
the grief of Captain Borrow&rsquo;s dog at the loss of his
master.&nbsp; He also explained the reason for his being in
London.&nbsp; He had been invited to paint the portrait of Robert
Hawkes, an ex-mayor of Norwich, for a fee of a hundred
guineas.&nbsp; Lacking confidence in his own ability, he had
declined the honour and suggested that Benjamin Haydon should be
approached.&nbsp; At the request of a deputation of his fellow
citizens, which had waited upon him, he had undertaken to enter
into negotiations with Haydon.&nbsp; He even undertook to come up
to London at his own expense, that he might see his old master
and complete the bargain.&nbsp; Borrow subsequently accompanied
his brother when calling upon Haydon, and was enabled to give a
thumbnail-sketch of the painter of the Heroic at work that has
been pronounced to be photographic in its faithfulness.</p>
<p>John returned to Norwich about a fortnight later accompanied
by Haydon, who was to become the guest of his sitter, <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a> and George was left to the compilation
of <i>Celebrated Trials</i>.&nbsp; Sir Richard Phillips appears
to have been a man as prolific of suggestion as he was destitute
of tact.&nbsp; He regarded his authors as the instruments of his
own genius.&nbsp; Their business it was to carry out his ideas in
a manner entirely congenial to his colossal conceit.&nbsp; His
latest author he exposed &ldquo;to incredible mortification and
ceaseless trouble from this same rage for
interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of all this was an attack of the
&ldquo;Horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towards the end of May, Roger
Kerrison received from Borrow a note saying that he believed
himself to be dying, and imploring him to &ldquo;come to me
immediately.&rdquo;&nbsp; The direct outcome of this note was,
not the death of Borrow, but the departure from Milman Street of
Roger Kerrison, lest he should become involved in a tragedy
connected with Borrow&rsquo;s oft-repeated threat of
suicide.&nbsp; Kerrison became &ldquo;very uneasy and
uncomfortable on his account, so that I have found it utterly
impossible to live any longer in the same lodgings with
him.&rdquo; <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; Looked at dispassionately it
seems nothing short of an act of cowardice on Kerrison&rsquo;s
part to leave alone a man such as Borrow, who might at any moment
be assailed by one of those periods of gloom from which suicide
seemed the only outlet.&nbsp; On the other hand, from an anecdote
told by C. G. Leland (&ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rdquo;), there seems
to be some excuse for Kerrison&rsquo;s wish to live alone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I knew at that time [about 1870],&rdquo; he writes, <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> &ldquo;a Mr Kerrison, who had been as
a young man, probably in the Twenties, on intimate terms with
Borrow.&nbsp; He told me that one night Borrow acted very wildly,
whooping and vociferating so as to cause the police to follow
him, and after a long run led them to the edge of the Thames,
&lsquo;and there they thought they had him.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he
plunged boldly into the water and swam in his clothes to the
opposite shore, and so escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A serious misfortune now befell Borrow in the premature death
of <i>The Universal Review</i>, which expired with the sixth
number (March 1824&mdash;January 1825).&nbsp; It is not known
what was the rate of pay to young and impecunious reviewers <a
name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a> certainly not large, if it may be
judged by the amount agreed upon for <i>Celebrated
Trials</i>.&nbsp; Still, its end meant that Borrow was now
dependent upon what he received for his compilation, and what he
merited by his translation into German of <i>Proximate
Causes</i>.</p>
<p>There appears to have been some difficulty about payment for
Borrow&rsquo;s contributions to the now defunct review, which
considerably widened the breach that the <i>Trials</i> had
created.&nbsp; Sir Richard became more exacting and more than
ever critical. <a name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a>&nbsp; The end could not be far
off.&nbsp; Borrow had come to London determined to be an author,
and by no juggling with facts could his present drudgery be
considered as authorship.&nbsp; Occasionally his mind reverted to
the manuscripts in the green box, his faith in which continued
undiminished.&nbsp; He made further efforts to get his
translations published, but everywhere the answer was the same,
in effect, &ldquo;A drug, sir, a drug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he determined to approach John Murray (the Second),
&ldquo;Glorious John, who lived at the western end of the
town&rdquo;; but he called many times without being successful in
seeing him.&nbsp; Another seventeen years were to elapse before
he was to meet and be published by John Murray.</p>
<p>Yet another dispute arose between Borrow and Sir Richard
Phillips.&nbsp; Neither appeared to have realised the supreme
folly of entrusting to a young Englishman the translation into
German of an English work.&nbsp; A novel would have presented
almost insurmountable difficulties; but a work of
philosophy!&nbsp; The whole project was absurd.&nbsp; The diction
of philosophy in all languages is individual, just as it is in
other branches of science, and a very thorough knowledge of, and
deep reading in both languages are necessary to qualify a man to
translate from a foreign tongue into his own.&nbsp; To expect an
inexperienced youth to reverse the order seems to suggest that
Sir Richard Phillips must have been a publisher whose enthusiasm
was greater than his judgment.</p>
<p>One day when calling at Tavistock Square, Borrow found Sir
Richard in a fury of rage.&nbsp; He had submitted the first
chapter of the translation of <i>Proximate Causes</i> to some
Germans, who found it utterly unintelligible.&nbsp; This was only
to be expected, as Borrow confesses that, when he found himself
unable to comprehend what was the meaning of the English text, he
had translated it <i>literally into German</i>!</p>
<p>The result of the interview was that Borrow, after what
appears to be a tactless, not to say impertinent, rejoinder, <a
name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> relapsed into silence and finally left
the house, ordered back to his compilation by Sir Richard, as
soon as he became sufficiently calm to appear coherent, and
Borrow walked away musing on the &ldquo;difference in clever
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discovery of the inadequacy of the German translation
apparently urged Borrow to hasten on with <i>Celebrated
Trials</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Universal Review</i> was dead, the
German version of <i>Proximate Causes</i> <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> had passed out of his hands.&nbsp; It
was desirable, therefore, that the remaining undertaking should
be completed as soon as possible, that the two might part.&nbsp;
The last of the manuscript was delivered, the proofs passed for
press, and on 19th March the work appeared, the six volumes,
running to between three and four thousand pages, containing
accounts of some four hundred trials, including that of
Borrow&rsquo;s old friend Thurtell for the murder of Mr
Weare.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s name did not appear.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;the
editor,&rdquo; and as such was referred to in the preface
contributed by Sir Richard himself.&nbsp; Among other things he
tells of how, in some cases, &ldquo;the Editor has compressed
into a score of pages the substance of an entire
volume.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Richard was a philosopher as well as a
preface-writing publisher, and it was only natural that he should
speculate as to the effect upon his editor&rsquo;s mind of months
spent in reading and editing such records of vice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may be expected,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that the
Editor should convey to his readers the intellectual impressions
which the execution of his task has produced on his mind.&nbsp;
He confesses that they are mournful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Richard was
either a master of irony, or a man of singular obtuseness.</p>
<p>One effect of this delving into criminal records had been to
raise in Borrow&rsquo;s mind strange doubts about virtue and
crime.&nbsp; When a boy, he had written an essay in which he
strove to prove that crime and virtue were mere terms, and that
we were the creatures of necessity or circumstance.&nbsp; These
broodings in turn reawakened the theory that everything is a lie,
and that nothing really exists except in our imaginations.&nbsp;
The world was &ldquo;a maze of doubt.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
indications of an overtaxed brain increased, and eventually
forced Borrow to leave London.&nbsp; His work was thoroughly
uncongenial.&nbsp; He disliked reviewing; he had failed in his
endeavours to render <i>Proximate Causes</i> into intelligible
German; and it had taken him some time to overcome his dislike of
the sordid stories of crime and criminals that he had to read and
edit.&nbsp; He became gloomy and depressed, and prone to compare
the real conditions of authorship with those that his imagination
had conjured up.</p>
<p>The most important result of his labours in connection with
<i>Celebrated Trials</i> was that upon his literary style.&nbsp;
There is a tremendous significance in the following
passage.&nbsp; It tells of the transition of the actual vagabond
into the literary vagabond, with power to express in words what
proved so congenial to Borrow&rsquo;s vagabond temperament:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of all my occupations at this period I am
free to confess I liked that of compiling the Newgate Lives and
Trials [Celebrated Trials] the best; that is, after I had
surmounted a kind of prejudice which I originally
entertained.&nbsp; The trials were entertaining enough; but the
lives&mdash;how full were they of wild and racy adventures, and
in what racy, genuine language were they told.&nbsp; What struck
me most with respect to these lives was the art which the
writers, whoever they were, possessed of telling a plain
story.&nbsp; It is no easy thing to tell a story plainly and
distinctly by mouth; but to tell one on paper is difficult
indeed, so many snares lie in the way.&nbsp; People are afraid to
put down what is common on paper, they seek to embellish their
narratives, as they think, by philosophic speculations and
reflections; they are anxious to shine, and people who are
anxious to shine can never tell a plain story.&nbsp; &lsquo;So I
went with them to a music booth, where they made me almost drunk
with gin, and began to talk their flash language, which I did not
understand,&rsquo; <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a> says, or is made
to say, Henry Simms, executed at Tyburn some seventy years before
the time of which I am speaking.&nbsp; I have always looked upon
this sentence as a masterpiece of the narrative style, it is so
concise and yet so clear.&rdquo; <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time the work was published and Borrow had been paid
his fee, all relations between editor and publisher had ceased,
and there was &ldquo;a poor author, or rather philologist, upon
the streets of London, possessed of many tongues,&rdquo; which he
found &ldquo;of no use in the world.&rdquo; <a
name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c"
class="citation">[52c]</a>&nbsp; A month after the appearance of
<i>Celebrated Trials</i> (18th April), and a little more than a
year after his arrival in London, Borrow published a translation
of Klinger&rsquo;s <i>Faustus</i>. <a name="citation53a"></a><a
href="#footnote53a" class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; He himself
gives no particulars as to whether it was commissioned or
no.&nbsp; It may even have been &ldquo;the Romance in the German
style&rdquo; from the Green Box.&nbsp; It is known that he
received payment for it by a bill at five or six months, <a
name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b"
class="citation">[53b]</a> but there is no mention of the
amount.&nbsp; It would appear that the translation had long been
projected, for in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, July 1824, there
appeared, in conjunction with the announcement of <i>Celebrated
Trials</i>, the following paragraph: &ldquo;The editor of the
preceding has ready for the press, a Life of Faustus, his Death
and Descent into Hell, which will also appear the next
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Faustus</i> did not meet with a very cordial
reception.&nbsp; <i>The Literary Gazette</i> (16th July 1825)
characterised it as &ldquo;another work to which no respectable
publisher ought to have allowed his name to be put.&nbsp; The
political allusion and metaphysics, which may have made it
popular among a low class in Germany, do not sufficiently season
its lewd scenes and coarse descriptions for British
palates.&nbsp; We have occasionally publications for the
fireside,&mdash;these are only fit for the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had apparently been in some doubt about certain
passages, for in a note headed &ldquo;The Translator to the
Public,&rdquo; he defends the work as moral in its general
teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The publication of the present volume may
at first sight appear to require some brief explanation from the
Translator, inasmuch as the character of the incidents may
justify such an expectation on the part of the reader.&nbsp; It
is, therefore, necessary to state that, although scenes of vice
and crime are here exhibited, it is merely in the hope that they
may serve as beacons, to guide the ignorant and unwary from the
shoals on which they might otherwise be wrecked.&nbsp; The work,
when considered as a whole, is strictly moral.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be confessed that Faustus does not err on the side of
restraint.&nbsp; Many of its scenes might appear &ldquo;lewd . .
. and coarse&rdquo; to anyone who for a moment allowed his mind
to wander from the morality of &ldquo;its general
teaching.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attacks upon the lax morals of the
priesthood must have proved particularly congenial to the
translator.</p>
<p>The more Borrow read his translations of Ab Gwilym, the more
convinced he became of their merit and the profit they would
bring to him who published them.&nbsp; The booksellers, however,
with singular unanimity, declined the risk of introducing to the
English public either Welsh or Danish ballads; and their
translator became so shabby in consequence, that he refrained
from calling upon his friend Arden, for whom he had always
cherished a very real friendship.&nbsp; He began to lose
heart.&nbsp; His energy left him and with it went hope.&nbsp; He
was forced to review his situation.&nbsp; Authorship had
obviously failed, and he found himself with no reasonable
prospect of employment.</p>
<p>There is no episode in Borrow&rsquo;s life that has so
exercised the minds of commentators and critics as his account of
the book he terms in <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>The Life and Adventures
of Joseph Sell</i>, <i>the Great Traveller</i>.&nbsp; Some
dismiss the whole story as apocryphal; others see in it a grain
of truth distorted into something of vital importance; whilst
there are a number of earnest Borrovians that accept the whole
story as it is written.&nbsp; Dr Knapp has said that Joseph Sell
&ldquo;was not a book at all, and the author of it never said
that it was.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was obviously an error, for the
bookseller is credited with saying, &ldquo;I think I shall
venture on sending your book to the press,&rdquo; <a
name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a> referring to it as a
&ldquo;book&rdquo; four times in nine lines.&nbsp; Again, in
another place, Borrow describes how he rescued himself
&ldquo;from peculiarly miserable circumstances by writing a book,
an original book, within a week, even as Johnson is said to have
written his <i>Rasselas</i> and Beckford his
<i>Vathek</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation55b"></a><a
href="#footnote55b" class="citation">[55b]</a>&nbsp; This removes
all question of the <i>Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell</i>
being included in a collection of short stories.&nbsp; The title
would not be the same, the date is most probably wrongly given,
as in the case of Marshland Shales; but the general accuracy of
the account as written seems to be highly probable.&nbsp; Many
efforts have been made to trace the story; but so far
unsuccessfully.&nbsp; It must be remembered that Borrow loved to
stretch the long arm of coincidence; but he loved more than
anything else a dramatic situation.&nbsp; He was always on the
look out for effective &ldquo;curtains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In favour of the story having been actually written, is the
knowledge that Borrow invented little or nothing.&nbsp;
Collateral evidence has shown how little he deviated from actual
happenings, although he did not hesitate to revise dates or
colour events.&nbsp; The strongest evidence, however, lies in the
atmosphere of truth that pervades Chapters LV.&ndash;LVII. of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; They are convincing.&nbsp; At one time or
another during his career, it would appear that Borrow wrote
against time from grim necessity; otherwise he must have been a
master of invention, which everything that is known about him
clearly shows that he was not.</p>
<p><i>Joseph Sell</i> has disappeared, a most careful search of
the Registers at Stationers&rsquo; Hall can show no trace of that
work, or any book that seems to suggest it, and the contemporary
literary papers render no assistance.</p>
<p>According to Borrow&rsquo;s own account, one morning on
getting up he found that he had only half a crown in the
world.&nbsp; It was this circumstance, coupled with the timely
notice that he saw affixed to a bookseller&rsquo;s window to the
effect that &ldquo;A Novel or Tale is much wanted,&rdquo; that
determined him to endeavour to emulate Dr Johnson and William
Beckford.&nbsp; He had tired of &ldquo;the Great City,&rdquo; and
his thoughts turned instinctively to the woods and the fields,
where he could be free to meditate and muse in solitude.</p>
<p>When he returned to Milman Street after seeing the
bookseller&rsquo;s advertisement, he found that his resources had
been still further reduced to eighteen-pence.&nbsp; He was too
proud to write home for assistance, he had broken with Sir
Richard Phillips, and he had no reasonable expectation of
obtaining employment of any description; for his accomplishments
found no place in the catalogue of everyday wants.&nbsp; He was a
proper man with his hands, and knew some score or more
languages.&nbsp; No matter how he regarded the situation, the
facts were obvious.&nbsp; Between him and actual starvation there
was the inconsiderable sum of eighteen-pence and the
bookseller&rsquo;s advertisement.&nbsp; The gravity of the
situation banished the cloud of despondency that threatened to
settle upon him, and also the doubts that presented themselves as
to whether he possessed the requisite ability to produce what the
bookseller required.&nbsp; The all-important question was, could
he exist sufficiently long on eighteen-pence to complete a
story?&nbsp; Sir Richard Phillips had told him to live on bread
and water.&nbsp; He now did so.</p>
<p>For a week he wrote ceaselessly at the <i>Life and Adventures
of Joseph Sell</i>, <i>the Great Traveller</i>.&nbsp; He wrote
with the feverish energy of a man who sees the shadow of actual
starvation cast across his manuscript.&nbsp; When the tale was
finished there remained the work of revision, and after that,
worst of all, fears lest the bookseller were already suited.</p>
<p>Fortune, however, was kind to him, and he was successful in
extracting for his story the sum of twenty pounds.&nbsp; Borrow
had not mixed among gypsies for nothing.&nbsp; He, a starving and
unknown author, succeeded in extracting from a bookseller twenty
pounds for a story, twice the amount offered by Sir Richard
Phillips for a novel on the lines of <i>The Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter</i>.&nbsp; It was an achievement.</p>
<p>The first argument against the story, as related by Borrow, is
that he was not without resources at the time.&nbsp; Why should
he be so impoverished a few weeks after receiving payment for
<i>Celebrated Trials</i>? <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; Above all, why
did he not realise upon Simpkin &amp; Marshall&rsquo;s bill for
<i>Faustus</i>?&nbsp; He would have experienced no difficulty in
discounting a bill accepted by such a firm.&nbsp; It seems hardly
conceivable that he should preserve this piece of paper when he
had only eighteen-pence in the world.&nbsp; Everything seems to
point to the fact that in May 1825 Borrow was not in want of
money, and if he were not, why did he almost kill himself by
writing the <i>Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell</i>?&nbsp;
Again, at that period he had met with no adventures such as might
be included in the life of a &ldquo;Great Traveller,&rdquo; and
Borrow was not an inventive writer.&nbsp; Later he possessed
plenty of material; for there can be no question that he roamed
about the world for a considerable portion of those seven
mysterious years of his life that came to be known as the
&ldquo;Veiled Period.&rdquo;&nbsp; His accuracy as to actual
occurrences has been so emphasised that this particular argument
holds considerable significance.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence against <i>Joseph Sell</i> having been
written in 1825, however, lies in the fact that Greenwich Fair
was held on 23rd May, and not 12th May, as given by Dr
Knapp.&nbsp; By his error Dr Knapp makes Borrow leave London a
day before the Fair took place that he describes.&nbsp; Borrow
must have left London on the day following Greenwich Fair (24th
May).&nbsp; If he left later, then those things which tend to
confirm his story of the life in the Dingle do not fit in, as
will be seen.&nbsp; He certainly could not have left before
Greenwich Fair was held.</p>
<p>In one of his brother John&rsquo;s letters, written at the end
of 1829, there is a significant passage, &ldquo;Let me know how
you sold your manuscript.&rdquo; <a name="citation58"></a><a
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a>&nbsp; What
manuscript is it that is referred to?&nbsp; There is no record of
George having sold a manuscript in the autumn of 1829.&nbsp; The
passage can scarcely have reference to some article or
translation; it seems to suggest something of importance, an
event in George&rsquo;s life that his brother is anxious to know
more about.&nbsp; If this be <i>Joseph Sell</i>, then it explains
where Borrow got the money from to go up to London at the end of
1829, when he entered into relations with Dr Bowring.&nbsp; It is
merely a theory, it must be confessed; but there is certain
evidence that seems to support it.&nbsp; In the first place,
Borrow was a chronicler before all else.&nbsp; He possessed an
amazing memory and a great gift for turning his experiences into
literary material.&nbsp; If he coloured facts, he appears to have
done so unconsciously, to judge from those portions of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> that were covered by letters to the Bible
Society.&nbsp; Not only are the facts the same, but, with very
slight changes, the words in which he relates them.&nbsp; He
never hesitated to change a date if it served his purpose, much
as an artist will change the position of a tree in a landscape to
suit the exigencies of composition.&nbsp; His five volumes of
autobiography bristle with coincidences so amazing that, if they
were actually true, he must have been the most remarkable genius
on record for attracting to himself strange adventures.&nbsp; He
met the sailor son of the old Apple-Woman returning from his
enforced exile; Murtagh tells him of how the postilion frightened
the Pope at Rome by his denunciation, a story Borrow had already
heard from the postilion himself; the Hungarian at Horncastle
narrates how an Armenian once silenced a Moldavian, the same
Moldavian whom Borrow had encountered in London; the postilion
meets the man in black again.&nbsp; There are scores of such
coincidences, which must be accepted as dramatic
embellishments.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
MAY&ndash;SEPTEMBER 1825</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fourteen</span> months in London had shown
Borrow how hard was the road of authorship.&nbsp; He confessed
that he was not &ldquo;formed by nature to be a pallid indoor
student.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The peculiar atmosphere of the big
city&rdquo; did not agree with him, and this fact, together with
the anxiety and hard work of the past twelve months, caused him
to flag, and his first thought was how to recover his
health.&nbsp; He was disillusioned as to the busy world, and the
opportunities it offered to a young man fired with ambition to
make a stir in it.&nbsp; He determined to leave London, which he
did towards the end of May, <a name="citation60"></a><a
href="#footnote60" class="citation">[60]</a> first despatching
his trunk &ldquo;containing a few clothes and books to the old
town [Norwich].&rdquo;&nbsp; He struck out in a south-westerly
direction, musing on his achievements as an author, and finding
that in having preserved his independence and health, he had
&ldquo;abundant cause to be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout his life Borrow was hypnotised by
independence.&nbsp; Like many other proud natures, he carried his
theory of independence to such an extreme as to become a slave to
it and render himself unsociable, sometimes churlish.&nbsp; It
was this virtue carried to excess that drove Borrow from
London.&nbsp; He must tell men what was in his mind, and his one
patron, Sir Richard Phillips, he had mortally offended in this
manner.</p>
<p>Finding that he was unequal to much fatigue, after a few
hours&rsquo; walking he hailed a passing coach, which took him as
far as Amesbury in Wiltshire.&nbsp; From here he walked to
Stonehenge and on to Salisbury, &ldquo;inspecting the curiosities
of the place,&rdquo; and endeavouring by sleep and good food to
make up the wastage of the last few months.&nbsp; The weather was
fine and his health and spirits rapidly improved as he tramped
on, his &ldquo;daily journeys varying from twenty to twenty-five
miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; He encountered the mysterious stranger who
&ldquo;touched&rdquo; against the evil eye.&nbsp; F. H. Groome
asserts, on the authority of W. B. Donne, that this was in
reality William Beckford.&nbsp; Borrow must have met him at some
other time and place, as he had already left Fonthill in
1825.&nbsp; It is, however, interesting to recall that Borrow
himself &ldquo;touched&rdquo; against the evil eye.&nbsp; Mr
Watts-Dunton has said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was nothing that Borrow strove
against with more energy than the curious impulse, which he seems
to have shared with Dr Johnson, to touch the objects along his
path in order to save himself from the evil chance.&nbsp; He
never conquered the superstition.&nbsp; In walking through
Richmond Park he would step out of his way constantly to touch a
tree, and he was offended if the friend he was with seemed to
observe it.&rdquo; <a name="citation61a"></a><a
href="#footnote61a" class="citation">[61a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chance meeting with Jack Slingsby (in fear of his life
from the Flaming Tinman, and bound by oath not to continue on the
same beat) gave Borrow the idea of buying out Slingsby, beat,
plant, pony and all.&nbsp; &ldquo;A tinker is his own master, a
scholar is not,&rdquo; <a name="citation61b"></a><a
href="#footnote61b" class="citation">[61b]</a> he remarks, and
then proceeds to draw tears and moans from the dispirited
Slingsby and his family by a description of the joys of
tinkering, &ldquo;the happiest life under heaven . . . pitching
your tent under the pleasant hedge-row, listening to the song of
the feathered tribes, collecting all the leaky kettles in the
neighbourhood, soldering and joining, earning your honest bread
by the wholesome sweat of your brow.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>By the expenditure of five pounds ten shillings, plus the cost
of a smock-frock and some provisions, George Borrow, linguist,
editor and translator, became a travelling tinker.&nbsp; With his
dauntless little pony, Ambrol, he set out, a tinkering Ulysses,
indifferent to what direction he took, allowing the pony to go
whither he felt inclined.&nbsp; At first he experienced some
apprehension at passing the night with only a tent or the stars
as a roof.&nbsp; Rain fell to mar the opening day of the
adventure, but the pony, with unerring instinct, led his new
master to one of Slingsby&rsquo;s usual camping grounds.</p>
<p>In the morning Borrow fell to examining what it was beyond the
pony and cart that his five pounds ten shillings had
purchased.&nbsp; He found a tent, a straw mattress and a blanket,
&ldquo;quite clean and nearly new.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were also a
frying-pan, a kettle, a teapot (broken in three pieces) and some
cups and saucers.&nbsp; The stock-in-trade &ldquo;consisted of
various tools, an iron ladle, a chafing-pan, and small bellows,
sundry pans and kettles, the latter being of tin, with the
exception of one which was of copper, all in a state of
considerable dilapidation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pans and kettles were
to be sold after being mended, for which purpose there was
&ldquo;a block of tin, sheet-tin, and solder.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
most precious of all his possessions was &ldquo;a small anvil and
bellows of the kind which are used in forges, and two hammers
such as smiths use, one great, and the other small.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; Borrow had learned the
blacksmith&rsquo;s art when in Ireland, and the anvil, bellows
and smith&rsquo;s hammers were to prove extremely useful.</p>
<p>A few days after pitching his tent, Borrow received from his
old enemy Mrs Herne, Mr Petulengro&rsquo;s mother-in-law, a
poisoned cake, which came very near to ending his career.&nbsp;
He then encountered the Welsh preacher (&ldquo;the worthiest
creature I ever knew&rdquo;) and his wife, who were largely
instrumental in saving him from Mrs Herne&rsquo;s poison.&nbsp;
Having remained with his new friends for nine days, he
accompanied them as far as the Welsh border, where he confessed
himself the translator of Ab Gwilym, giving as an excuse for not
accompanying them further that it was &ldquo;neither fit nor
proper that I cross into Wales at this time, and in this
manner.&nbsp; When I go into Wales, I should wish to go in a new
suit of superfine black, with hat and beaver, mounted on a
powerful steed, black and glossy, like that which bore Greduv to
the fight of Catraeth.&nbsp; I should wish, moreover,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;to see the Welshmen assembled on the border
ready to welcome me with pipe and fiddle, and much whooping and
shouting, and to attend me to Wrexham, or even as far as
Machynllaith, where I should wish to be invited to a dinner at
which all the bards should be present, and to be seated at the
right hand of the president, who, when the cloth was removed,
should arise, and amidst cries of silence,
exclaim&mdash;&lsquo;Brethren and Welshmen, allow me to propose
the health of my most respectable friend the translator of the
odes of the great Ab Gwilym, the pride and glory of
Wales.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation63a"></a><a
href="#footnote63a" class="citation">[63a]</a></p>
<p>He returned with Mr Petulengro, who directed him to Mumber
Lane (Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle), near Willenhall, in Staffordshire,
&ldquo;the little dingle by the side of the great north
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Borrow encamped and shod little Ambrol,
who kicked him over as a reminder of his clumsiness.</p>
<p>He had refused an invitation from Mr Petulengro to become a
Romany <i>chal</i> and take a Romany bride, the granddaughter of
his would-be murderess, who &ldquo;occasionally talked of&rdquo;
him.&nbsp; He yearned for solitude and the country&rsquo;s
quiet.&nbsp; He told Mr Petulengro that he desired only some
peaceful spot where he might hold uninterrupted communion with
his own thoughts, and practise, if so inclined, either tinkering
or the blacksmith&rsquo;s art, and he had been directed to
Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, which was to become the setting of the
most romantic episode in his life.</p>
<p>In the dingle Borrow experienced one of his worst attacks of
the &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Screaming
Horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; He raged like a madman, a prey to some
indefinable, intangible fear; clinging to his &ldquo;little horse
as if for safety and protection.&rdquo; <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp; He had not recovered from the
prostrating effects of that night of tragedy when he was called
upon to fight Anselo Herne, &ldquo;the Flaming Tinman,&rdquo; who
somehow or other seemed to be part of the bargain he had made
with Jack Slingsby, and encounter the queen of road-girls, Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; The description of the fight has been proclaimed
the finest in our language, and by some the finest in the
world&rsquo;s literature.</p>
<p>Isopel Berners is one of the great heroines of English
Literature.&nbsp; As drawn by Borrow, with her strong arm,
lion-like courage and tender tearfulness, she is unique.&nbsp;
However true or false the account of her relations with Borrow
may be, she is drawn by him as a living woman.&nbsp; He was
incapable of conceiving her from his imagination.&nbsp; It may go
unquestioned that he actually met an Isopel Berners, <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a> but whether or no his parting from her
was as heart-rendingly tragic as he has depicted it, is open to
very grave question.</p>

</a></p>
<p>With this queen of the roads he seems to have been less
reticent and more himself than with any other of his vagabond
acquaintance, not excepting even Mr Petulengro.&nbsp; To the
handsome, tall girl with &ldquo;the flaxen hair, which hung down
over her shoulders unconfined,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;determined
but open expression,&rdquo; he showed a more amiable side of his
character; yet he seems to have treated her with no little
cruelty.&nbsp; He told her about himself, how he &ldquo;had tamed
savage mares, wrestled with Satan, and had dealings with
ferocious publishers,&rdquo; bringing tears to her eyes, and when
she grew too curious, he administered an antidote in the form of
a few Armenian numerals.&nbsp; If his <i>Autobiography</i> is to
be credited, Isopel loved him, and he was aware of it; but the
knowledge did not hinder him from torturing the poor girl by
insisting that she should decline the verb &ldquo;to love&rdquo;
in Armenian.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s attitude towards Isopel was curiously complex;
he seemed to find pleasure in playing upon her emotions.&nbsp; At
times he appeared as deliberately brutal to her, as to the gypsy
girl Ursula when he talked with her beneath the hedge.&nbsp; He
forced from Isopel a passionate rebuke that he sought only to vex
and irritate &ldquo;a poor ignorant girl . . . who can scarcely
read or write.&rdquo;&nbsp; He asked her to marry him, but not
until he had convinced her that he was mad.&nbsp; How much she
had become part of his life in the dingle he did not seem to
realise until after she had left him.&nbsp; Isopel Berners was a
woman whose character was almost masculine in its strength; but
she was prepared to subdue her spirit to his, wished to do so
even.&nbsp; With her strength, however, there was wisdom, and she
left Borrow and the dingle, sending him a letter of farewell that
was certainly not the composition of &ldquo;a poor girl&rdquo;
who could &ldquo;scarcely read or write.&rdquo;&nbsp; The story
itself is in all probability true; but the letter rings
false.&nbsp; Isopel may have sent Borrow a letter of farewell,
but not the one that appears in <i>The Romany Rye</i>.</p>
<p>Among Borrow&rsquo;s papers Dr Knapp discovered a fragment of
manuscript in which Mr Petulengro is shown deliberating upon the
expediency of emulating King Pharaoh in the number of his
wives.&nbsp; Mrs Petulengro desires &ldquo;a little pleasant
company,&rdquo; and urges her husband to take a second
spouse.&nbsp; He proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now I am thinking that this here Bess of
yours would be just the kind of person both for my wife and
myself.&nbsp; My wife wants something <i>gorgiko</i>, something
genteel.&nbsp; Now Bess is of blood gorgious; if you doubt it,
look at her face, all full of <i>pawno ratter</i>, white blood,
brother; and as for gentility, nobody can make exceptions to
Bess&rsquo;s gentility, seeing she was born in the workhouse of
Melford the Short.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Petulengro sees in Bess another advantage.&nbsp; If
&ldquo;the Flaming Tinman&rdquo; <a name="citation66a"></a><a
href="#footnote66a" class="citation">[66a]</a> were to descend
upon them, as he once did, with the offer to fight the best of
them for nothing, and Tawno Chikno were absent, who was to fight
him?&nbsp; Mr Petulengro could not do so for less than five
pounds; but with Bess as a second wife the problem would be
solved.&nbsp; She would fight &ldquo;the Flaming
Tinman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proves nothing, one way or the other, and can scarcely be
said to &ldquo;dispel any allusions,&rdquo; as Dr Knapp suggests,
or confirm the story of Isopel.&nbsp; Why did Borrow omit it from
Lavengro?&nbsp; Not from caprice surely.&nbsp; It has been stated
that those who know the gypsies can vouch for the fact that no
such suggestion could have been made by a gypsy woman.</p>
<p>It would appear that Isopel Berners existed, but the account
of her given by Borrow in Lavengro and The Romany Rye is in all
probability coloured, just as her stature was heightened by
him.&nbsp; If she were taller than he, she must have appeared a
giantess.&nbsp; Borrow was an impressionist, and he has probably
succeeded far better in giving a faithful picture of Isopel
Berners than if he had been photographically accurate in his
measurements.</p>
<p>According to Borrow&rsquo;s own account, he left Willenhall
mounted upon a fine horse, purchased with money lent to him by Mr
Petulengro, a small valise strapped to the saddle, and
&ldquo;some desire to meet with one of those adventures which
upon the roads of England are generally as plentiful as
blackberries.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this point, however, <i>The
Romany Rye</i> becomes dangerous as autobiography. <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a></p>
<p>For one thing, it was unlike Borrow to remain in debt, and it
is incredible that he should have ridden away upon a horse
purchased with another man&rsquo;s money, without any set purpose
in his mind.&nbsp; Therefore the story of his employment at the
Swan Inn, Stafford, where he found his postilion friend, and the
subsequent adventures must be reluctantly sacrificed.&nbsp; They
do not ring true, nor do they fit in with the rest of the
story.&nbsp; That he experienced such adventures is highly
probable; but it is equally probable that he took some liberty
with the dates.</p>
<p>Up to the point where he purchases the horse, Borrow&rsquo;s
story is convincing; but from there onwards it seems to go to
pieces, that is as autobiography.&nbsp; The arrival of Ardry
(Arden) at the inn, <a name="citation67a"></a><a
href="#footnote67a" class="citation">[67a]</a> <i>passing through
Stafford on his way to Warwick</i> to be present at a dog and
lion fight that had already taken place (26th July), is in itself
enough to shake our confidence in the whole episode of the
inn.&nbsp; In <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i> Mr Petulengro is made
to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I suppose you have not forgot how, fifteen
years ago, when you made horseshoes in the little dingle by the
side of the great north road, I lent you fifty cottors [guineas]
to purchase the wonderful trotting cob of the innkeeper with the
green Newmarket coat, which three days after you sold for two
hundred.&nbsp; Well, brother, if you had wanted the two hundred
instead of the fifty, I could have lent them to you, and would
have done so, for I knew you would not be long pazorrhus
[indebted] to me.&rdquo; <a name="citation67b"></a><a
href="#footnote67b" class="citation">[67b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems more in accordance with Borrow&rsquo;s character to
repay the loan within three days than to continue in Mr
Petulengro&rsquo;s debt for weeks, at one time making no actual
effort to realise upon the horse.&nbsp; The question as to
whether Borrow received a hundred and fifty (as he himself
states) or two hundred pounds is immaterial.&nbsp; It is quite
likely that he sold the horse before he left the dingle, and that
the adventures he narrates may be true in all else save the
continued possession of his steed, that is, with the exception of
the Francis Ardry episode, the encounter with the man in black,
and the arrival at Horncastle during the fair.&nbsp; If Borrow
left London on 24th May, and he could not have left earlier, as
has been shown, he must have visited the Fair (Tamworth) with Mr
Petulengro on 26th July, and set out from Willenhall about 2nd
August.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out by that distinguished scholar and
gentleman-gypsy, Mr John Sampson, <a name="citation68"></a><a
href="#footnote68" class="citation">[68]</a> that as the Horse
Fair at Horncastle was held 12th&ndash;21st August, if Borrow
took the horse there it could not have been in the manner
described in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, where he is shown as spending
some considerable time at the inn, if we may judge by the
handsome cheque (&pound;10) offered to him by the landlord as a
bonus on account of his services.&nbsp; Then there was the
accident and the consequent lying-up at the house of the man who
knew Chinese, but could not tell what o&rsquo;clock it was.&nbsp;
To confirm Borrow&rsquo;s itinerary all this must have been
crowded into less than three weeks, fully a third of which Borrow
spent in recovering from his fall.&nbsp; This would mean that for
less than a fortnight&rsquo;s work, the innkeeper offered him ten
pounds as a gratuity, in addition to the bargain he had made,
which included the horse&rsquo;s keep.</p>
<p>Mr Sampson has supported his itinerary with several very
important pieces of evidence.&nbsp; Borrow states in
<i>Lavengro</i> that &ldquo;a young moon gave a feeble
light&rdquo; as he mounted the coach that was to take him to
Amesbury.&nbsp; The moon was in its first quarter on 24th
May.&nbsp; There actually was a great thunderstorm in the
Willenhall district about the time that Borrow describes (18th
July).&nbsp; It is Mr Sampson also who has identified the fair to
which Borrow went with the gypsies as that held at Tamworth on
26th July.</p>
<p>Whatever else Borrow may have been doing immediately after
leaving the dingle, he appears to have been much occupied in
speculating as to the future.&nbsp; Was he not &ldquo;sadly
misspending his time?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was forced to the
conclusion that he had done nothing else throughout his life but
misspend his time.&nbsp; He was ambitious.&nbsp; He chafed at his
narrow life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! what a vast deal may be done with
intellect, courage, riches, accompanied by the desire of doing
something great and good!&rdquo; <a name="citation69a"></a><a
href="#footnote69a" class="citation">[69a]</a> he exclaims, and
his thoughts turned instinctively to the career of his old
school-fellow, Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a>&nbsp; He was now, by his own
confession, &ldquo;a moody man, bearing on my face, as I well
knew, the marks of my strivings and my strugglings, of what I had
learnt and unlearnt.&rdquo; <a name="citation69c"></a><a
href="#footnote69c" class="citation">[69c]</a>&nbsp; He
recognised the possibilities that lay in every man, only awaiting
the hour when they should be called forth.&nbsp; He believed
implicitly in the power of the will. <a name="citation69d"></a><a
href="#footnote69d" class="citation">[69d]</a>&nbsp; He possessed
ambition and a fine workable theory of how success was to be
obtained; but he lacked initiative.&nbsp; He expected fortune to
wait for him on the high-road, just as he knew adventures awaited
him.&nbsp; He would not go &ldquo;across the country,&rdquo; to
use a phrase of the time common to postilions.&nbsp; He was too
independent, perhaps too sensitive of being patronised, to seek
employment.&nbsp; That he cared &ldquo;for nothing in this world
but old words and strange stories,&rdquo; was an error into which
his friend Mr Petulengro might well fall.&nbsp; The mightiness of
the man&rsquo;s pride could be covered only by a cloak of assumed
indifference.&nbsp; He must be independent of the world, not only
in material things, but in those intangible qualities of the
spirit.&nbsp; It was this that lost him Isopel Berners, whose
love he awakened by a strong right arm and quenched with an
Armenian noun.&nbsp; Again, his independence stood in the way of
his happiness.&nbsp; A man is a king, he seemed to think, and the
attribute of kings is their splendid isolation, their godlike
solitude.&nbsp; If his Ego were lonely and crying out for
sympathy, Borrow thought it a moment for solitude, in which to
discipline his insurgent spirit.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo;
were the result of this self-repression.&nbsp; When they became
unbearable, his spirit broke down, the yearning for sympathy and
affection overmastered him, and he stumbled to his little horse
in the desolate dingle, and found comfort in the faithful
creature&rsquo;s whinny of sympathy and its affectionate licking
of his hand.&nbsp; The strong man clung to his dumb brute friend
as a protection against the unknown horror&mdash;the screaming
horror that had gripped him.</p>
<p>One quality Borrow possessed in common with many other men of
strange and taciturn personality.&nbsp; He could always make
friends when he chose.&nbsp; Ostlers, scholars, farmers, gypsies;
it mattered not one jot to him what, or who they were.&nbsp; He
could earn their respect and obtain their good-will, if he wished
to do so.&nbsp; He demanded of men that they should have done
things, or be capable of doing things.&nbsp; They must know
everything there was to be known about some one thing; and the
ostler, than whom none could groom a horse better, was worthy of
being ranked with the best man in the land.&nbsp; He demanded of
every man that he should justify his existence, and was logical
in his attitude, save in the insignificant particular that he
applied the same rule to himself only in theory.</p>
<p>He was shrewd and a good judge of character, provided it were
Protestant character, and could hold his own with a Jew or a
Gypsy.&nbsp; He was fully justified in his boast of being able to
take &ldquo;precious good care of&rdquo; himself, and
&ldquo;drive a precious hard bargain&rdquo;; yet these qualities
were not to find a market until he was thirty years of age.</p>
<p>Sometime during the autumn (1825) Borrow returned to Norwich,
where he busied himself with literary affairs, among other things
writing to the publishers of <i>Faustus</i> about the bill that
was shortly to fall due.&nbsp; The fact of the book having been
destroyed at both the Norwich libraries, gave him the idea that
he might make some profit by selling copies of the suppressed
volume.&nbsp; Hence his offer to Simpkin &amp; Marshall to take
copies in lieu of money.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
SEPTEMBER 1825&ndash;DECEMBER 1832</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the autumn of 1825 until the
winter of 1832, when he obtained an introduction to the British
&amp; Foreign Bible Society, only fragmentary details of
Borrow&rsquo;s life exist.&nbsp; He decided to keep sacred to
himself the &ldquo;Veiled Period,&rdquo; as it came to be
called.&nbsp; In all probability it was a time of great hardship
and mortification, and he wished it to be thought that the whole
period was devoted to &ldquo;a grand philological
expedition,&rdquo; or expeditions.&nbsp; There is no doubt that
some portion of the mysterious epoch was so spent, but not
all.&nbsp; Many of the adventures ascribed to characters in
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> were, most probably,
Borrow&rsquo;s own experiences during that period of mystery and
misfortune.&nbsp; Time after time he was implored to &ldquo;lift
up a corner of the curtain&rdquo;; but he remained obdurate, and
the seven years are in his life what the New Orleans days were in
that of Walt Whitman.</p>
<p>Soon after his return to Norwich, Borrow seems to have turned
his attention to the manuscripts in the green box.&nbsp; In the
days of happy augury, before he had quarrelled with Sir Richard
Phillips, there had appeared in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i> the
two following paragraphs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have heard and seen much of the legends
and popular superstitions of the North, but, in truth, all the
exhibitions of these subjects which have hitherto appeared in
England have been translations from the German.&nbsp; Mr Olaus
Borrow, who is familiar with the Northern Languages, proposes,
however, to present these curious reliques of romantic antiquity
directly from the Danish and Swedish, and two elegant volumes of
them now printing will appear in September.&nbsp; They are highly
interesting in themselves, but more so as the basis of most of
the popular superstitions of England, when they were introduced
during the incursions and dominion of the Danes and
Norwegians.&rdquo;&nbsp; (1st September 1824.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to acknowledge the favour of a beautiful
collection of Danish songs and ballads, of which a specimen will
be seen among the poetical articles of the present month.&nbsp;
One, or more, of these very interesting translations will appear
in each succeeding number.&rdquo;&nbsp; (1st December 1824.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to have been Borrow&rsquo;s plan to run his ballads
serially through <i>The Monthly Magazine</i> and then to publish
them in book-form.&nbsp; His initial contribution to <i>The
Monthly Magazine</i> had appeared in October 1823.&nbsp; The
first of the articles, entitled &ldquo;Danish Traditions and
Superstitions,&rdquo; appeared August 1824, and continued, with
the omission of one or two months, until December 1825, there
being in all nine articles; but there was only one instalment of
&ldquo;Danish Songs and Ballads.&rdquo; <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was determined that these ballads, at least, should be
published, and he set to work to prepare them for the
press.&nbsp; Allan Cunningham, with whom Borrow was acquainted,
contributed, at his request, a metrical dedication.&nbsp; The
volume appeared on 10th May, in an edition of five hundred copies
at ten shillings and sixpence each.&nbsp; It appears that some
two hundred copies were subscribed for, thus ensuring the cost of
production.&nbsp; The balance, or a large proportion of it, was
consigned to John Taylor, the London publisher, who printed a new
title-page and sold them at seven shillings each, probably the
trade price for a half-guinea book.</p>
<p>Cunningham wrote to Borrow advising him to send out freely
copies for review, and with each a note saying that it was the
translator&rsquo;s ultimate intention to publish an English
version of the whole <i>Ki&aelig;mpe Viser</i> with notes; also
to &ldquo;scatter a few judiciously among literary
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is doubtful if this sage counsel were acted
upon; for there is no record of any review or announcement of the
work.&nbsp; This in itself was not altogether a misfortune; for
Borrow did not prove himself an inspired translator of
verse.&nbsp; Apart from the two hundred copies sold to
subscribers, the book was still-born.</p>
<p>After the publication of <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, Borrow
appears to have returned to London, not to his old lodging at
Milman Street, possibly on account of the associations, but to 26
Bryanston Street, Portman Square, from which address he wrote to
Benjamin Haydon the following note:&mdash;<a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>I should feel extremely obliged if you would allow me to sit
to you as soon as possible.&nbsp; I am going to the South of
France in little better than a fortnight, and I would sooner lose
a thousand pounds than not have the honour of appearing in the
picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his account of how he first became acquainted with Haydon,
Borrow shows himself as anything but desirous of appearing in a
picture.&nbsp; When John tells of the artist&rsquo;s wish to
include him as one of the characters in a painting upon which he
is engaged, Borrow replies: &ldquo;I have no wish to appear on
canvas.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that in some way or other
Haydon offended his sitter, who, regretting his acquiescence,
antedated the episode and depicted himself as refusing the
invitation.&nbsp; Such a liberty with fact and date would be
quite in accordance with Borrow&rsquo;s autobiographical
methods.</p>
<p>Borrow wrote in <i>Lavengro</i>, &ldquo;I have been a wanderer
the greater part of my life; indeed I remember only two periods,
and these by no means lengthy, when I was, strictly speaking,
stationary.&rdquo; <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a>&nbsp; One of the
&ldquo;two periods&rdquo; was obviously the eight years spent at
Norwich, 1816&ndash;24, the other is probably the years spent at
Oulton.&nbsp; Thus the &ldquo;Veiled Period&rdquo; may be assumed
to have been one of wandering.&nbsp; The seven years are gloomy
and mysterious, but not utterly dark.&nbsp; There is a hint here,
a suggestion there&mdash;a letter or a paragraph, that gives in a
vague way some idea of what Borrow was doing, and where.&nbsp; It
seems comparatively safe to assume that after the publication of
<i>Romantic Ballads</i> he plunged into a life of roving and
vagabondage, which, in all probability, was brought to an abrupt
termination by either the loss or the exhaustion of his
money.&nbsp; Anything beyond this is pure conjecture. <a
name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b"
class="citation">[75b]</a></p>
<p>After he became associated with the British &amp; Foreign
Bible Society, his movements are easily accounted for; but all we
have to guide us as to what countries he had seen before 1833 is
an occasional hint.&nbsp; He casually admits having been in
Italy, <a name="citation75c"></a><a href="#footnote75c"
class="citation">[75c]</a> at Bayonne, <a
name="citation75d"></a><a href="#footnote75d"
class="citation">[75d]</a> Paris, <a name="citation75e"></a><a
href="#footnote75e" class="citation">[75e]</a> Madrid, <a
name="citation75f"></a><a href="#footnote75f"
class="citation">[75f]</a> the south of France. <a
name="citation75g"></a><a href="#footnote75g"
class="citation">[75g]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I have visited most of
the principal capitals of the world,&rdquo; he writes in 1843;
and again in the same year, &ldquo;I have heard the ballad of
Alonzo Guzman chanted in Danish, by a hind in the wilds of
Jutland.&rdquo; <a name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I have lived in different
parts of the world, much amongst the Hebrew race, and I am well
acquainted with their words and phraseology,&rdquo; <a
name="citation76b"></a><a href="#footnote76b"
class="citation">[76b]</a> he writes; and on another occasion:
&ldquo;I have seen gypsies of various lands, Russian, Hungarian,
and Turkish; and I have also seen the legitimate children of most
countries of the world.&rdquo; <a name="citation76c"></a><a
href="#footnote76c" class="citation">[76c]</a>&nbsp; An even more
significant admission is that made when Colonel Elers Napier,
whom Borrow met in Seville in 1839, enquired where he had
obtained his knowledge of Moultanee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some years ago,
in Moultan,&rdquo; was the reply; then, as if regretting that he
had confessed so much, showed by his manner that he intended to
divulge nothing more. <a name="citation76d"></a><a
href="#footnote76d" class="citation">[76d]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, during my own wanderings in Italy,&rdquo; Borrow
writes, &ldquo;I rested at nightfall by the side of a kiln, the
air being piercingly cold; it was about four leagues from
Genoa.&rdquo; <a name="citation76e"></a><a href="#footnote76e"
class="citation">[76e]</a>&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;Once in the south
of France, when I was weary, hungry, and penniless, I observed
one of these last patterans <a name="citation76f"></a><a
href="#footnote76f" class="citation">[76f]</a> [a cross marked in
the dust], and following the direction pointed out, arrived at
the resting-place of &lsquo;certain Bohemians,&rsquo; by whom I
was received with kindness and hospitality, on the faith of no
other word of recommendation than patteran.&rdquo; <a
name="citation76g"></a><a href="#footnote76g"
class="citation">[76g]</a>&nbsp; In a letter of introduction to
the Rev. E. Whitely, of Oporto, the Rev. Andrew Brandram, of the
Bible Society, wrote in 1835: &ldquo;With Portugal he [Borrow] is
already acquainted, and speaks the language.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
statement is significant, for only during the &ldquo;Veiled
Period&rdquo; could Borrow have visited Portugal.</p>
<p>It may be argued that Borrow was merely posing as a great
traveller, but the foregoing remarks are too casual, too much in
the nature of asides, to be the utterances of a poseur.&nbsp; A
man seeking to impress himself upon the world as a great
traveller would probably have been a little more definite.</p>
<p>The only really reliable information as to Borrow&rsquo;s
movements after his arrival in London is contained in the note to
Haydon.&nbsp; In all probability he went to Paris, where possibly
he met Vidocq, the master-rogue turned detective. <a
name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a>&nbsp; It has been suggested by Dr
Knapp that he went to Paris, and thence on foot to Bayonne and
Madrid, after which he tramped to Pamplona, where he gets into
trouble, is imprisoned, and is released on condition that he
leave the country; he proceeds towards Marseilles and Genoa,
where he takes ship and is landed safely in London.&nbsp; The
data, however, upon which this itinerary is constructed are too
frail to be convincing.&nbsp; There is every probability that he
roamed about the Continent and met with adventures&mdash;he was a
man to whom adventures gravitated quite naturally&mdash;but the
fact of his saying that he had been imprisoned on three
occasions, and there being only two instances on record at the
time, cannot in itself be considered as conclusive evidence of
his having been arrested at Pamplona. <a
name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1827 Borrow was unquestionably at Norwich,
for he saw the famous trotting stallion Marshland Shales on the
Castle Hill (12th April), and did for that grand horse
&ldquo;what I would neither do for earl or baron, doffed my
hat.&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; Borrow apparently remained with
his mother for some months, to judge from certain entries (29th
September to 19th November) in his hand that appear in her
account books.</p>
<p>In December 1829 he was back again in London at 77 Great
Russell Street, W.C.&nbsp; He was as usual eager to obtain some
sort of work.&nbsp; He wrote to &ldquo;the Committee of the
Honourable and Praiseworthy Association, known by the name of the
Highland Society . . . a body animate with patriotism, which,
guided by philosophy, produces the noblest results, and many of
whose members stand amongst the very eminent in the various
departments of knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project itself was that of translating into English
&ldquo;the best and most approved poetry of the Ancient and
Modern Scoto-Gaelic Bards, with such notes on the usages and
superstitions therein alluded to, as will enable the English
reader to form a clear and correct idea of the
originals.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of a rather ornate letter,
Borrow offers himself as the translator and compiler of such a
work as he suggests, avowing his willingness to accept whatsoever
remuneration might be thought adequate compensation for his
expenditure of time.&nbsp; Furthermore, he undertakes to complete
the work within a period of two years.</p>
<p>On 7th December he wrote to Dr Bowring, recently returned from
Denmark:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lest I should intrude upon you when you are
busy, I write to enquire when you will be unoccupied.&nbsp; I
wish to show you my translation of The Death of Balder,
Ewald&rsquo;s most celebrated production, which, if you approve
of, you will perhaps render me some assistance in bringing forth,
for I don&rsquo;t know many publishers.&nbsp; I think this will
be a proper time to introduce it to the British public, as your
account of Danish literature will doubtless cause a
sensation.&rdquo; <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 29th December he wrote again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I had last the pleasure of being at
yours, you mentioned that we might at some future period unite
our strength in composing a kind of Danish Anthology.&nbsp;
Suppose we bring forward at once the first volume of the Danish
Anthology, which should contain the heroic supernatural songs of
the <i>K</i>[<i>i&aelig;mpe</i>]
<i>V</i>[<i>iser</i>].&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was suggested that there should be four volumes in all, and
the first, with an introduction that Borrow expressed himself as
not ashamed of, was ready and &ldquo;might appear instanter, with
no further trouble to yourself than writing, if you should think
fit, a page or two of introductory matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr
Bowring replied by return of post that he thought that no more
than two volumes could be ventured on, and Borrow acquiesced,
writing: &ldquo;The sooner the work is advertised the better,
<i>for I am terribly afraid of being forestalled in the
Ki&aelig;mpe Viser by some of those Scotch blackguards</i>, who
affect to translate from all languages, of which they are fully
as ignorant as Lockhart is of Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was full of enthusiasm for the project, and repeated
that the first volume was ready, adding: &ldquo;If we unite our
strength in the second, I think we can produce something worthy
of fame, for we shall have plenty of matter to employ talent
upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; A later letter, which was written from 7
Museum Street (8th January), told how he had &ldquo;been obliged
to decamp from Russell St. for the cogent reason of an execution
having been sent into the house, and I thought myself happy in
escaping with my things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew up a prospectus, endeavouring &ldquo;to assume a
Danish style,&rdquo; which he submitted to his collaborator,
begging him to &ldquo;alter . . . whatever false logic has crept
into it, find a remedy for its incoherencies, and render it fit
for its intended purpose.&nbsp; I have had for the two last days
a rising headache which has almost prevented me doing
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would appear that Dr Bowring did not altogether approve of
the &ldquo;Danish style,&rdquo; for on 14th January Borrow wrote,
&ldquo;I approve of the prospectus in every respect; it is
business-like, and there is nothing flashy in it.&nbsp; I do not
wish to suggest one alteration . . .&nbsp; When you see the
foreign Editor,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;I should feel much
obliged if you would speak to him about my reviewing Tegner, and
enquire whether a <i>good</i> article on Welsh poetry would be
received.&nbsp; I have the advantage of not being a
Welshman.&nbsp; I would speak the truth, and would give
translations of some of the best Welsh poetry; and I really
believe that my translations would not be the worst that have
been made from the Welsh tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospectus, which appeared in several publications ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr Bowring and Mr George Borrow are about
to publish, dedicated to the King of Denmark, by His
Majesy&rsquo;s permission, THE SONGS OF SCANDINAVIA, in 2 vols.
8vo, containing a Selection of the most interesting of the
Historical and Romantic Ballads of North-Western Europe, with
Specimens of the Danish and Norwegian Poets down to the present
day.</p>
<p>Price to Subscribers, &pound;1, 1s.&mdash;to Non-Subscribers
&pound;1, 5s.</p>
<p>The First Volume will be devoted to Ancient Popular Poetry;
the Second will give the choicest productions of the Modern
School, beginning with Tullin.&rdquo; <a name="citation81"></a><a
href="#footnote81" class="citation">[81]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Songs of Scandinavia</i> now became to Borrow what the
<i>Celebrated Trials</i> had been four years previously, a source
of constant toil.&nbsp; On one occasion he writes to Dr Bowring
telling him that he has just translated an ode &ldquo;as I
breakfasted.&rdquo;&nbsp; What Borrow lived on at this period it
is impossible to say.&nbsp; It may be assumed that Mrs Borrow did
not keep him, for, apart from the slender proportions of the
income of the mother, the unconquerable independence of the son
must be considered; and Borrow loved his mother too tenderly to
allow her to deprive herself of luxuries even to keep him.&nbsp;
He borrowed money from her at various times; but he subsequently
faithfully repaid her.&nbsp; Even John was puzzled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You never tell me what you are doing,&rdquo; he writes to
his brother at the end of 1832; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be living
on nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow appears to have kept Dr Bowring well occupied with
suggestions as to how that good-natured man might assist
him.&nbsp; Although he is to see him on the morrow, he writes on
the evening of 21st May regarding another idea that has just
struck him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As at present no doubt seems to be
entertained of Prince Leopold&rsquo;s accepting the sovereignty
of Greece, would you have any objection to write to him
concerning me?&nbsp; I should be very happy to go to Greece in
his service.&nbsp; I do not wish to go in a civil or domestic
capacity, and I have, moreover, no doubt that all such situations
have been long since filled up; I wish to go in a military one,
for which I am qualified by birth and early habits.&nbsp; You
might inform the Prince that I have been for years on the
Commander-in-Chiefs list for a commission, but that I have not
had sufficient interest to procure an appointment.&nbsp; One of
my reasons for wishing to reside in Greece is, that the mines of
Eastern literature would be accessible to me.&nbsp; I should soon
become an adept in Turkish, and would weave and transmit to you
such an anthology as would gladden your very heart.&nbsp; As for
the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>, all the ballads would be ready
before departure, and as I should have books, I would in a few
months send you translations of the modern Lyric Poetry.&nbsp; I
hope this letter will not displease you.&nbsp; I do not write it
from <i>flightiness</i>, but from thoughtfulness.&nbsp; I am
uneasy to find myself at four and twenty drifting on the sea of
the world, and likely to continue so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 22nd May Dr Bowring introduced Borrow to Dr Grundtvig, the
Danish poet, who required some transcriptions done.&nbsp; On 7th
June, Borrow wrote to Dr Bowring:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have looked over Mr Gruntvig&rsquo;s
(<i>sic</i>) manuscript.&nbsp; It is a very long affair, and the
language is Norman Saxon.&nbsp; &pound;40 would not be an
extravagant price for a transcript, and so they told him at the
Museum.&nbsp; However, as I am doing nothing particular at
present, and as I might learn something from transcribing it, I
would do it for &pound;20.&nbsp; He will call on you to-morrow
morning, and then, if you please, you may recommend me.&nbsp; The
character closely resembles the ancient Irish, so I think you can
answer for my competency.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this time there were a hundred schemes seething through
Borrow&rsquo;s eager brain.&nbsp; Hearing that &ldquo;an order
has been issued for the making a transcript of the celebrated
Anglo-Saxon Codex of Exeter, for the use of the British
Museum,&rdquo; he applied to some unknown correspondent for his
interest and help to obtain the appointment as transcriber.&nbsp;
The work, however, was carried out by a Museum official.</p>
<p>Another project appears to have been to obtain a post at the
British Museum.&nbsp; On 9th March 1830 he had written to Dr
Bowring:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have thought over the Museum matter,
which we were talking about last night, and it appears to me that
it would be the very thing for me, provided that it could be
accomplished.&nbsp; I should feel obliged if you would deliberate
upon the best mode of proceeding, so that when I see you again I
may have the benefit of your advice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply Dr Bowring commended the scheme, and promised to
assist &ldquo;by every sort of counsel and exertion.&nbsp; But it
would injure you,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;if I were to take
the initiative.&nbsp; [The Gibraltar house of Bowring &amp;
Murdock had recently failed.]&nbsp; Quietly make yourself master
of that department of the Museum.&nbsp; We must then think of how
best to get at the Council.&nbsp; If by any management they can
be induced to ask my opinion, I will give you a character which
shall take you to the top of Hecla itself.&nbsp; You have claims,
strong ones, and I should rejoice to see you <i>niched</i> in the
British Museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again failure!&nbsp; Disappointment seemed to be dogging
Borrow&rsquo;s footsteps at this period.&nbsp; For years past he
had been seeking some sort of occupation, into which he could
throw all that energy and determination of character that he
possessed.&nbsp; He was earnest and able, and he knew that he
only required an opportunity of showing to the world what manner
of man he was.&nbsp; He seemed doomed to meet everywhere with
discouragement; for no one wanted him, just as no one wanted his
translations of the glorious Ab Gwilym.&nbsp; He appeared before
the world as a failure, which probably troubled him very little;
but there was another aspect of the case that was in his eyes,
&ldquo;the most heartbreaking of everything, the strange, the
disadvantageous light in which I am aware that I must frequently
have appeared to those whom I most love and honour.&rdquo; <a
name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a></p>
<p>On 14th September he wrote to Dr Bowring:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am going to Norwich for some short time,
as I am very unwell and hope that cold bathing in October and
November may prove of service to me.&nbsp; My complaints are, I
believe, the offspring of ennui and unsettled prospects.&nbsp; I
have thoughts of attempting to get into the French service, as I
should like prodigiously to serve under Clausel in the next
Bedouin campaign.&nbsp; I shall leave London next Sunday and will
call some evening to take my leave; I cannot come in the morning,
as early rising kills me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year later he writes again to Dr Bowring, who once more has
been exerting himself on his friend&rsquo;s behalf:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Willow Lane</span>, <span
class="smcap">Norwich</span>,<br />
11<i>th</i> <i>September</i> 1831.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>I return you my most sincere thanks for your kind letter of
the 2nd inst., and though you have not been successful in your
application to the Belgian authorities in my behalf, I know full
well that you did your utmost, and am only sorry that at my
instigation you attempted an impossibility.</p>
<p>The Belgians seem either not to know or not to care for the
opinion of the great Cyrus who gives this advice to his
captains.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take no heed from what countries ye fill
up your ranks, but seek recruits as ye do horses, not those
particularly who are of your own country, but those of
merit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Belgians will only have such recruits as
are born in Belgium, and when we consider the heroic manner in
which the native Belgian army defended the person of their new
sovereign in the last conflict with the Dutch, can we blame them
for their determination?&nbsp; It is rather singular, however,
that resolved as they are to be served only by themselves they
should have sent for 5000 Frenchmen to clear their country of a
handful of Hollanders, who have generally been considered the
most unwarlike people in Europe, but who, if they had fair play
given them, would long ere this time have replanted the Orange
flag on the towers of Brussels, and made the Belgians what they
deserve to be, hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Sir, allow me to reply to a very important
part of your letter; you ask me whether I wish to purchase a
commission in the British service, because in that case you would
speak to the Secretary at War about me.&nbsp; I must inform you
therefore that my name has been for several years upon the list
for the purchase of a commission, and I have never yet had
sufficient interest to procure an appointment.&nbsp; If I can do
nothing better I shall be very glad to purchase; but I will pause
two or three months before I call upon you to fulfil your kind
promise.&nbsp; It is believed that the Militia will be embodied
in order to be sent to that unhappy country Ireland, and provided
I can obtain a commission in one of them, and they are kept in
service, it would be better than spending &pound;500 about one in
the line.&nbsp; I am acquainted with the Colonels of the two
Norfolk regiments, and I daresay that neither of them would have
any objection to receive me.&nbsp; If they are not embodied I
will most certainly apply to you, and you may say when you
recommend me that being well grounded in Arabic, and having some
talent for languages, I might be an acquisition to a corps in one
of our Eastern Colonies.&nbsp; I flatter myself that I could do a
great deal in the East provided I could once get there, either in
a civil or military capacity; there is much talk at present about
translating European books into the two great languages, the
Arabic and Persian; now I believe that with my enthusiasm for
these tongues I could, if resident in the East, become in a year
or two better acquainted with them than any European has been
yet, and more capable of executing such a task.&nbsp; Bear this
in mind, and if before you hear from me again you should have any
opportunity to recommend me as a proper person to fill any civil
situation in those countries or to attend any expedition thither,
I pray you to lay hold of it, and no conduct of mine shall ever
give you reason to repent it.</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">My Dear Sir,<br />
Your most obliged and obedient Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Present my best remembrances to Mrs B. and
to Edgar, and tell them that they will both be starved.&nbsp;
There is now a report in the street that twelve corn-stacks are
blazing within twenty miles of this place.&nbsp; I have lately
been wandering about Norfolk, and I am sorry to say that the
minds of the peasantry are in a horrible state of excitement; I
have repeatedly heard men and women in the harvest-field swear
that not a grain of the corn they were cutting should be eaten,
and that they would as lieve be hanged as live.&nbsp; I am afraid
all this will end in a famine and a rustic war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was pride that prompted Borrow to ask Dr Bowring to stay
his hand for the moment about a commission.&nbsp; There was no
reasonable possibility of his being able to raise
&pound;500.&nbsp; Even if his mother had possessed it, which she
did not, he would not have drained her resources of so large an
amount.&nbsp; His subsequent attitude towards the Belgians was
characteristic of him.&nbsp; To his acutely sensitive
perceptions, failure to obtain an appointment he sought was a
rebuff, and his whole nature rose up against what, at the moment,
appeared to be an intolerable slight.</p>
<p>Nothing came of the project of collaboration between Bowring
and Borrow beyond an article on Danish and Norwegian literature
that appeared in <i>The Foreign Quarterly Review</i> (June 1830),
in which Borrow supplied translations of the sixteen poems
illustrating Bowring&rsquo;s text.&nbsp; In all probability the
response to the prospectus was deemed inadequate, and Bowring did
not wish to face a certain financial loss.</p>
<p>From Borrow&rsquo;s own letters there is no question that Dr
Bowring was acting towards him in a most friendly manner, and
really endeavouring to assist him to obtain some sort of
employment.&nbsp; It may be, as has been said, and as seems
extremely probable, that Bowring used his &ldquo;facility in
acquiring and translating tongues deliberately as a ladder to an
administrative post abroad,&rdquo; <a name="citation86a"></a><a
href="#footnote86a" class="citation">[86a]</a> but if Borrow
&ldquo;put a wrong construction upon his sympathy&rdquo; and was
led into &ldquo;a veritable <i>cul-de-sac</i> of
literature,&rdquo; <a name="citation86b"></a><a
href="#footnote86b" class="citation">[86b]</a> it was no fault of
Bowring&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s relations with Dr Bowring continued to be most
cordial for many years, as his letters show.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray
excuse me for troubling you with these lines,&rdquo; he writes
years later; &ldquo;I write to you, as usual, for assistance in
my projects, convinced that you will withhold none which it may
be in your power to afford, more especially when by so doing you
will perhaps be promoting the happiness of our
fellow-creatures.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is very significant as
indicating the nature of the relations between the two men.</p>
<p>Borrow was to experience yet another disappointment.&nbsp; A
Welsh bookseller, living in the neighbourhood of Smithfield,
commissioned him to translate into English Elis Wyn&rsquo;s
<i>The Sleeping Bard</i>, a book printed originally in
1703.&nbsp; The bookseller foresaw for the volume a large sale,
not only in England but in Wales; but &ldquo;on the eve of
committing it to the press, however, the Cambrian-Briton felt his
small heart give way within him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were I to print
it,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I should be ruined; the terrible
descriptions of vice and torment would frighten the genteel part
of the English public out of its wits, and I should to a
certainty be prosecuted by Sir James Scarlett . . . Myn
Diawl!&nbsp; I had no idea, till I had read him in English, that
Elis Wyn had been such a terrible fellow.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a></p>
<p>With this Borrow had to be content and retire from the
presence of the little bookseller, who told him he was
&ldquo;much obliged . . . for the trouble you have given yourself
on my account,&rdquo; <a name="citation87b"></a><a
href="#footnote87b" class="citation">[87b]</a> and his bundle of
manuscript, containing nearly three thousand lines, the work
probably of some months, was to be put aside for thirty years
before eventually appearing in a limited edition.</p>
<p>It cannot be determined with exactness when Borrow
relinquished the unequal struggle against adverse circumstances
in London.&nbsp; He had met with sufficient discouragement to
dishearten him from further effort.&nbsp; Perhaps his greatest
misfortune was his disinclination to make friends with anybody
save vagabonds.&nbsp; He could attract and earn the friendship of
an apple-woman, thimble-riggers, tramps, thieves, gypsies, in
short with any vagrant he chose to speak to; but his hatred of
gentility was a great and grave obstacle in the way of his
material advancement.&nbsp; His brother John seemed to recognise
this; for in 1831 he wrote, &ldquo;I am convinced that <i>your
want of success in life</i> is more owing to your being unlike
other people than to any other cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would appear that, finding nothing to do in London, Borrow
once more became a wanderer.&nbsp; He was in London in March; but
on 27th, 28th, and 29th July 1830 he was unquestionably in
Paris.&nbsp; Writing about the Revolution of La Granja (August
1836) and of the energy, courage and activity of the war
correspondents, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I saw them [the war correspondents] during
the three days at Paris, mingled with <i>canaille</i> and
<i>gamins</i> behind the barriers, whilst the <i>mitraille</i>
was flying in all directions, and the desperate cuirassiers were
dashing their fierce horses against these seemingly feeble
bulwarks.&nbsp; There stood they, dotting down their observations
in their pocket-books as unconcernedly as if reporting the
proceedings of a reform meeting in Covent Garden or Finsbury
Square.&rdquo; <a name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can have reference only to the &ldquo;Three Glorious
Days&rdquo; of Revolution, 27th to 29th July 1830, during which
Charles X. lost, and Louis-Philippe gained, a throne.&nbsp; He
returned to Norwich sometime during the autumn of 1830. <a
name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a>&nbsp; In November he was entering upon
his epistolary duel with the Army Pay Office in connection with
John&rsquo;s half-pay as a lieutenant in the West Norfolk
Militia.</p>
<p>In 1826 John had gone to Mexico, then looked upon as a land of
promise for young Englishmen, who might expect to find fortunes
in its silver mines.&nbsp; Allday, brother of Roger Kerrison, was
there, and John Borrow determined to join him.&nbsp; Obtaining a
year&rsquo;s leave of absence from his colonel, together with
permission to apply for an extension, he entered the service of
the Real del Monte Company, receiving a salary of three hundred
pounds a year.&nbsp; He arranged that his mother should have his
half-pay, and it was in connection with this that George entered
upon a correspondence with the Army Pay Office that was to extend
over a period of fifteen months.</p>
<p>Originally John had arranged for the amounts to be remitted to
Mexico, and he sent them back again to his mother.&nbsp; This
involved heavy losses in connection with the bills of exchange,
and wishing to avoid this tax, John sent to his brother an
official copy of a Mexican Power of Attorney, which George strove
to persuade the Army Pay Office was the original.</p>
<p>Tact was unfortunately not one of George Borrow&rsquo;s
acquirements at this period, and in this correspondence he
adopted an attitude that must have seriously prejudiced his
case.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a solicitor myself, Sir,&rdquo; he
states, and proceeds to threaten to bring the matter before
Parliament.&nbsp; He writes to the Solicitor of the Treasury
&ldquo;as a member of the same honourable profession to which I
was myself bred up,&rdquo; and demands whether he has not law,
etc., on his side.&nbsp; The outcome of the correspondence was
that the disembodied allowance was refused on the plea
&ldquo;that Lieutenant Borrow having been absent without Leave
from the Training of the West Norfolk Militia has, under the
provisions of the 12th Section of the Militia Pay and Clothing
Act, forfeited his Allowance.&rdquo;&nbsp; In consequence,
payment was made only for the amount due from 25th June 1829 to
24th December 1830.&nbsp; The whole tone of Borrow&rsquo;s
letters was unfortunate for the cause he pleaded.&nbsp; He wrote
to the Secretary of State for War as he might have written to the
little Welsh bookseller with &ldquo;the small heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was indignant at what he conceived to be an injustice, and was
unable to dissemble his anger.</p>
<p>George had thought of joining his brother, but had not
received any very marked encouragement to do so.&nbsp; John
despised Mexican methods.&nbsp; On one occasion he writes apropos
of George&rsquo;s suggestion of the army, &ldquo;If you can raise
the pewter, come out here rather than that, and
<i>rob</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One sage thing at least John is to be
credited with, when he wrote to his brother, &ldquo;Do not enter
the army; it is a bad spec.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would have been for
George Borrow.</p>
<p>Among the papers left at Borrow&rsquo;s death was a fragment
of a political article in dispraise of the Radicals.&nbsp; The
editorial &ldquo;We&rdquo; suggests that Borrow might possibly
have been engaged in political journalism.&nbsp; The statement
made by him that he &ldquo;frequently spoke up for
Wellington&rdquo; <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> may or may not have had reference to
contributions to the press.&nbsp; The fragment itself proves
nothing.&nbsp; Many would-be journalists write
&ldquo;leaders&rdquo; that never see the case-room.</p>
<p>It is useless to speculate further regarding the period that
Borrow himself elected to veil from the eyes, not only of his
contemporaries, but those of another generation.&nbsp; Men who
have overcome adverse conditions and achieved fame are not as a
rule averse from publishing, or at least allowing to be known,
the difficulties that they had to contend with.&nbsp; Borrow was
in no sense of the word an ordinary man.&nbsp; He unquestionably
suffered acutely during the years of failure, when it seemed
likely that his life was to be wasted, barren of anything else
save the acquirement of a score or more languages; keys that
could open literary storehouses that nobody wanted to explore, to
the very existence of which, in fact, the public was frigidly
indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor George . . .&nbsp; I wish he was making money . .
. He works hard and remains poor,&rdquo; is the comment of his
brother John, written in the autumn of 1830.&nbsp; To no small
degree Borrow was responsible for his own failure, or perhaps it
would be more just to say that he had been denied many of the
attributes that make for success.&nbsp; His independence was
aggressive, and it offended people.&nbsp; Even with the Welsh
Preacher and his wife he refused to unbend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What a disposition!&rsquo;&rdquo; Winifred had
exclaimed, holding up her hands; &ldquo;&lsquo;and this is pride,
genuine pride&mdash;that feeling which the world agrees to call
so noble.&nbsp; Oh, how mean a thing is pride! never before did I
see all the meanness of what is called pride!&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a></p>
<p>This pride, magnificent as the loneliness of kings, and about
as unproductive of a sympathetic view of life, always constituted
a barrier in the way of Borrow&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; There were
innumerable other obstacles: his choice of friends, his fierce
denunciatory hatred of gentility, together with humbug, which he
always seemed to confuse with it, the attacks of the
&ldquo;Horrors,&rdquo; his grave bearing, which no laugh ever
disturbed, and, above all, his uncompromising hostility to the
things that the world chose to consider excellent.&nbsp; The
world in return could make nothing of a man who was a mass of
moods and sensibilities, strange tastes and pursuits.&nbsp; It is
not remarkable that he should fail to make the stir that he had
hoped to make.</p>
<p>With the unerring instinct of a hypersensitive nature, he knew
his merit, his honesty, his capacity&mdash;knew that he possessed
one thing that eventually commands success, which &ldquo;through
life has ever been of incalculable utility to me, and has not
unfrequently supplied the place of friends, money, and many other
things of almost equal importance&mdash;iron perseverance,
without which all the advantages of time and circumstance are of
very little avail in any undertaking.&rdquo; <a
name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a>&nbsp; It was this dogged determination
that was to carry him through the most critical period of his
life, enable him to earn the approval of those in whose interests
he worked, and eventually achieve fame and an unassailable place
in English literature.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
JANUARY&ndash;JULY 1833</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not a little curious that no
one should have thought of putting Borrow&rsquo;s undoubted gifts
as a linguist to some practical use.&nbsp; He himself had
frequently cast his eyes in the direction of a political
appointment abroad.&nbsp; It remained, however, for the Rev.
Francis Cunningham, <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a> vicar of Lowestoft,
in Suffolk, to see in this young man against whom the curse of
Babel was inoperative, a sword that, in the hands of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, might be wielded with considerable
effect against the heathen.</p>
<p>Borrow appears to have become acquainted with the Rev. Francis
Cunningham through the Skeppers of Oulton Hall, near Lowestoft,
of whom it is necessary to give some account.&nbsp; Edmund
Skepper had married Anne Breame of Beetley, who, on the death of
her father, came into &pound;9000.&nbsp; She and her husband
purchased the Oulton Hall estate, upon which Anne Skepper seems
to have been given a five per cent. mortgage.&nbsp; There were
two children of the marriage, Breame (born 1794) and Mary (born
1796).&nbsp; The boy inherited the estate, and the girl the
mortgage, worth about &pound;450 per annum.&nbsp; Mary married
Henry Clarke, a lieutenant in the Navy (26th July 1817), who
within eight months died of consumption.&nbsp; Two months later
Mrs Clarke gave birth to a daughter, who was christened Henrietta
Mary.&nbsp; Mrs Clarke became acquainted with the Cunninghams
while they were at Pakefield, and there is every reason to
believe that she was instrumental in introducing Borrow to
Cunningham.&nbsp; It is most probable that they met during
Borrow&rsquo;s visit at Oulton Hall in November 1832.</p>
<p>The Rev. Francis Cunningham appears to have been impressed by
Borrow&rsquo;s talent for languages, and fully alive to his value
to an institution such as the Bible Society, of which he,
Cunningham, was an active member.&nbsp; He accordingly addressed
<a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a> to the secretary, the Rev. Andrew
Brandram, the following letter:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Lowestoft Vicarage</span>,<br />
27<i>th</i> <i>Dec.</i> 1832.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>A young farmer in this neighbourhood has introduced me to-day
to a person of whom I have long heard, who appears to me to
promise so much that I am induced to offer him to you as a
successor of Platt and Greenfield. <a name="citation93b"></a><a
href="#footnote93b" class="citation">[93b]</a>&nbsp; He is a
person without University education, but who has read the Bible
in thirteen languages.&nbsp; He is independent in circumstances,
of no very defined denomination of Christians, but I think of
certain Christian principle.&nbsp; I shall make more enquiry
about him and see him again.&nbsp; Next week I propose to meet
him in London, and I could wish that you should see him, and, if
you please, take him under your charge for a few days.&nbsp; He
is of the middle order in Society, and a very produceable
person.</p>
<p>I intend to be in town on Tuesday morning to go to the Socy.
P. C. K.&nbsp; On Wednesday is Dr Wilson&rsquo;s meeting at
Islington.&nbsp; He may be in town on Monday evening, and will
attend to any appointment.</p>
<p>Will you write me word by return of post, and believe me
ever</p>
<p>Most truly and affectionately yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">F. <span
class="smcap">Cunningham</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recommendation was well-timed, for the Bible Society at
that particular moment required such a man as Borrow for a
Manchu-Tartar project it had in view.&nbsp; In 1821 the Bible
Society had commissioned Step&aacute;n Vasili&eacute;vitch
Lipovzoff, <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a> of St Petersburg, to translate the New
Testament into Manchu, the court and diplomatic language of
China.&nbsp; A year later, an edition of 550 copies of the First
Gospel was printed from type specially cast for the
undertaking.&nbsp; A hundred copies were despatched to
headquarters in London, and the remainder, together with the
type, placed with the Society&rsquo;s bankers at St Petersburg,
<a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a> until the time should arrive for the
distribution of the books.</p>
<p>Three years after (1824), the overflowing Neva flooded the
cellars in which the books were stored, causing their
irretrievable ruin, and doing serious damage to the type.&nbsp;
This misfortune appeared temporarily to discourage the
authorities at home, although Mr Lipovzoff was permitted to
proceed with the work of translation, which he completed in two
years from the date of the inundation.</p>
<p>In 1832 the Rev. Wm. Swann, of the London Missionary Society,
discovered in the famous library of Baron Schilling de Canstadt
at St Petersburg the manuscript of a Manchu translation of
&ldquo;the principal part of the Old Testament,&rdquo; and two
books of the New.&nbsp; The discovery was considered to be so
important that Mr Swann decided to delay his departure for his
post in Siberia and make a transcription, which he did.&nbsp; The
Manchu translation was the work of Father Puerot,
&ldquo;originally a Jesuit emissary at Pekin [who] passed the
latter years of his life in the service of the Russian Mission in
the capacity of physician.&rdquo; <a name="citation95"></a><a
href="#footnote95" class="citation">[95]</a></p>
<p>The immediate outcome of Mr Cunningham&rsquo;s letter was an
interview between Borrow and the Bible Society&rsquo;s
officials.&nbsp; With characteristic energy and determination,
Borrow trudged up to London, covering the 112 miles on foot in
27.5 hours.&nbsp; His expenses by the way amounted to
fivepence-halfpenny for the purchase of a roll, two apples, a
pint of ale and a glass of milk.&nbsp; On reaching London he
proceeded direct to the Bible Society&rsquo;s offices in Earl
Street, in spite of the early hour, and there awaited the arrival
of the Rev. Andrew Brandram (Secretary), and the Rev. Joseph
Jowett (Literary Superintendent).</p>
<p>The story of Borrow&rsquo;s arrival at Earl Street was
subsequently told, by one of the secretaries at a provincial
meeting in connection with the Bible Society.&nbsp; The Rev.
Wentworth Webster writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was little more than a boy when I first
heard George Borrow spoken of at the annual dinner given by a
connection of my family to the deputation of the British and
Foreign Bible Society in a country town near London . . . I can
distinctly recall one of the secretaries telling of his first
meeting with Borrow, whom he found waiting at the offices of the
Society one morning;&mdash;how puzzled he was by his appearance;
how, after he had read his letter of introduction, he wished to
while away the time until a brother secretary should arrive, and
did not want to say anything to commit himself to such a strange
applicant; so he began by politely hoping that Borrow had slept
well.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not aware that I fell asleep on the
road,&rsquo; was the reply; I have walked from Norwich to
London.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation96a"></a><a
href="#footnote96a" class="citation">[96a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that this conference took place on Friday, 4th
January; for on that day there is an entry in the records of the
Society of the loan to George Borrow of several books from the
Society&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; On this and subsequent occasions,
Borrow was examined as to his capabilities, the result appearing
to be quite satisfactory.&nbsp; To judge from the books lent to
Borrow, one of the subjects would seem to have been Arabic.</p>
<p>Borrow appeared before the Committee on 14th January, with the
result that they seemed to be &ldquo;quite satisfied with me and
my philological capabilities,&rdquo; which they judged of from
the report given by the Secretary and his colleague.&nbsp; A more
material sign of approval was found in the undertaking to defray
&ldquo;the expenses of my journey to and from London, and also of
my residence in that city, in the most handsome manner.&rdquo; <a
name="citation96b"></a><a href="#footnote96b"
class="citation">[96b]</a>&nbsp; That is to say, the Committee
voted him the sum of ten pounds.</p>
<p>Borrow had been formally asked if he were prepared to learn
Manchu sufficiently well to edit, or translate, into that
language such portions of the Scriptures as the Society might
decide to issue, provided means of acquiring the language were
put within his reach, and employment should follow as soon as he
showed himself proficient.&nbsp; To this Borrow had willingly
agreed.&nbsp; At this period, the idea appears to have been to
execute the work in London.</p>
<p>Shortly after appearing before the Committee Borrow returned
to Norwich, this time by coach, with several books in the
Manchu-Tartar dialect, including the Gospel of St Matthew and
Amyot&rsquo;s Manchu-French Dictionary.&nbsp; His instructions
were to learn the language and come up for examination in six
months&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Possibly the time limit was suggested
by Borrow himself, for he had said that he believed he could
master any tongue in a few months.</p>
<p>After two or three weeks of incessant study of a language that
Amyot says &ldquo;one may acquire in five or six years,&rdquo;
Borrow, who, it should be remembered, possessed no grammar of the
tongue, wrote to Mr Jowett:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is, then, your opinion that, from the
lack of anything in the form of Grammar, I have scarcely made any
progress towards the attainment of Manchu: <a
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a> perhaps you will not be perfectly
miserable at being informed that you were never more mistaken in
your life.&nbsp; I can already, with the assistance of Amyot,
translate Manchu with no great difficulty, and am perfectly
qualified to write a critique on the version of St
Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel, which I brought with me into the country
. . . I will now conclude by beseeching you to send me, as soon
as possible, <i>whatever can serve to enlighten me in respect to
Manchu Grammar</i>, for, had I a Grammar, I should in a
month&rsquo;s time be able to send a Manchu translation of
<i>Jonah</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The racy style of Borrow&rsquo;s letters must have been
something of a revelation to the Bible Society&rsquo;s officers,
who seem to have shown great tact and consideration in dealing
with their self-confident correspondent There is something
magnificent in the letters that Borrow wrote about this period;
their directness and virility, their courage and determination
suggest, not a man who up to the thirtieth year of his age has
been a conspicuous failure, as the world gauges failure; but one
who had grown confident through many victories and is merely
proceeding from one success to another.</p>
<p>Whilst in London, Borrow had discussed with Mr Brandram
&ldquo;the Gypsies and the profound darkness as to religion and
morality that envolved them.&rdquo; <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a>&nbsp; The Secretary
told him of the Southampton Committee for the Amelioration of the
Condition of the Gypsies that had recently been formed by the
Rev. James Crabbe for the express purpose of enlightening and
spreading the Gospel among the Romanys.&nbsp; Furthermore, Mr
Brandram, on hearing of Borrow&rsquo;s interest in, and knowledge
of, the gypsies, had requested him immediately on his return to
Norwich to draw up a vocabulary of Mr Petulengro&rsquo;s
language, during such time as he might have free from his other
studies.&nbsp; Borrow showed himself, as usual, prolific of
suggestions, all of which involved him in additional
labour.&nbsp; He enquired through Mr Jowett if Mr Brandram would
write about him to the Southampton Committee.&nbsp; He wished to
translate into the gypsy tongue the Gospel of St John,
&ldquo;which I could easily do,&rdquo; he tells Mr Jowett,
&ldquo;with the assistance of one or two of the old people, but
then they must be paid, for the gypsies are more mercenary than
the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also informed Mr Jowett that he had a brother in Mexico,
subsequently assuring him that he had no doubt of John&rsquo;s
willingness to assist the Society in &ldquo;flinging the rays of
scriptural light o&rsquo;er that most benighted and miserable
region.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sent to his brother, at Mr Jowett&rsquo;s
request, first a sheet, and afterwards a complete copy, of the
Gospel of St Luke translated into Nahuatl, the prevailing dialect
of the Mexican Indians, by Mariano Paz y Sanchez. <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a></p>
<p>In addition to learning Manchu, Borrow is credited with
correcting and passing for press the Nahuatl version of St. Luke.
<a name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a>&nbsp; The Bible Society&rsquo;s
records, however, point to the fact that this work was carried
through by John Hattersley, who later was to come up with Borrow
for examination in Manchu.&nbsp; In the light of this, the
following passage from one of John&rsquo;s letters is puzzling in
the extreme:&mdash;&ldquo;I have just received your letter of the
16th of February, together with your translation of St
Luke.&nbsp; I am glad you have got the job, but I must say that
the Bible Society are just throwing away their time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes on to explain how many dialects there are in
Mexico.&nbsp; &ldquo;The job&rdquo; can only refer to the Mexican
translation, as, at that period, Borrow was merely studying
Manchu.&nbsp; He had received no appointment from the
Society.&nbsp; It may have happened that Borrow expressed a wish
to look through the proofs and that a set was sent to him for
this purpose; but there seems no doubt that the actual official
responsibility for the work rested with Hattersley.&nbsp; A very
important point in support of this view is that there is no
record of Borrow being paid anything in connection with this
Mexican translation, beyond the amount of fifteen shillings and
fivepence, which he had expended in postage on the advance sheet
and complete copy sent to John.&nbsp; To judge from the
subsequent financial arrangements between the Society and its
agent, it is very improbable that he was given work to do without
payment.</p>
<p>After seven weeks&rsquo; study Borrow wrote again to Mr
Jowett:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am advancing at full gallop, and . . .
able to translate with pleasure and facility the specimens of the
best authors who have written in the language contained in the
compilation of the Klaproth.&nbsp; But I confess that the want of
a Grammar has been, particularly in the beginning of my course, a
great clog to my speed, and I have little doubt that had I been
furnished with one I should have attained my present knowledge of
Manchu in half the time.&nbsp; I was determined, however, not to
be discouraged, and, not having a hatchet at hand to cut down the
tree with, to attack it with my knife; and I would advise every
one to make the most of the tools which happen to be in his
possession until he can procure better ones, and it is not
improbable that by the time the good tools arrive he will find he
has not much need of them, having almost accomplished his
work.&rdquo; <a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a hint of the difficulties he was experiencing in his
confession that tools would still be of service to him, in
particular &ldquo;this same tripartite Grammar which Mr Brandram
is hunting for, my ideas respecting Manchu construction being
still very vague and wandering.&rdquo; <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; There is also a request for
&ldquo;the original grammatical work of Amyot, printed in the
<i>Memoires</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation100c"></a><a
href="#footnote100c" class="citation">[100c]</a></p>
<p>Borrow had been studying Manchu for seven weeks when, feeling
that his glowing report of the progress he was making might be
regarded as &ldquo;a piece of exaggeration and vain
boasting,&rdquo; he enclosed a specimen translation from Manchu
into English.&nbsp; This he accompanied with an assurance that,
if required, he could at that moment edit any book printed in the
Manchu dialect.&nbsp; About this period Mr Jowett and his
colleagues passed from one sensation to another.&nbsp; The calm
confidence of this astonishing man was more than justified by his
performance.&nbsp; His attitude towards life was strange to Earl
Street.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks from the date of commencing his study of
Manchu, Borrow wrote again to Mr Jowett with unmistakable
triumph: &ldquo;I have mastered Manchu, and I should feel obliged
by your informing the Committee of the fact, and also my
excellent friend Mr Brandram.&rdquo;&nbsp; He proceeds to
indicate some of the many difficulties with which he has had to
contend, the absolute difference of Manchu from all the other
languages that he has studied, with the single exception of
Turkish; the number of its idiomatic phrases, which must of
necessity be learnt off by heart; the little assistance he has
had in the nature of books.&nbsp; Finally he acknowledges
&ldquo;the assistance of God,&rdquo; and asks &ldquo;to be
regularly employed, for though I am not in want, my affairs are
not in a very flourishing condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The response to this letter was an invitation to proceed to
London to undergo an examination.&nbsp; His competitor was John
Hattersley, upon whom, in the event of Borrow&rsquo;s failure,
would in all probability have devolved the duty of assisting Mr
Lipovzoff.&nbsp; A Manchu hymn, a p&aelig;an to the great
F&ucirc;tsa, was the test.&nbsp; Each candidate prepared a
translation, which was handed to the examiners, who in turn were
to report to the Sub-Committee.&nbsp; Borrow returned to Norwich
to await the result.&nbsp; This was most probably towards the end
of June. <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>Mr Jowett wrote encouragingly to Borrow of his prospects of
obtaining the coveted appointment.&nbsp; In acknowledgment of
this letter, Borrow dashed off a reply, magnificent in its
confidence and manly sincerity.&nbsp; It was a defiance to the
fate that had so long dogged his footsteps.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What you have written has given me great
pleasure,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;as it holds out hope that I may
be employed usefully to the Deity, to man, and myself.&nbsp; I
shall be very happy to visit St Petersburg and to become the
coadjutor of Lipovzoff, <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a> and to avail
myself of his acquirements in what you very happily designate a
most singular language, towards obtaining a still greater
proficiency in it.&nbsp; I flatter myself that I am for one or
two reasons tolerably well adapted for the contemplated
expedition, for besides a competent knowledge of French and
German, I possess some acquaintance with Russian, being able to
read without much difficulty any printed Russian book, and I have
little doubt that after a few months intercourse with the
natives, I should be able to speak it fluently.&nbsp; It would
ill become me to bargain like a Jew or a Gypsy as to terms; all I
wish to say on that point is, that I have nothing of my own,
having been too long dependent on an excellent mother, who is not
herself in very easy circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst still waiting for the confirmation by the General
Committee of the Sub-Committee&rsquo;s resolution, which was
favourable to Borrow, Mr Jowett wrote to him (5th July), telling
him how good were his prospects; but warning him not to be too
confident of success.&nbsp; The Sub-Committee had recommended
that Borrow&rsquo;s services should be engaged that he might go
to St Petersburg and assist Mr Lipovzoff in editing St Luke and
the Acts and any other portions of the New Testament that it was
thought desirable to publish in Manchu.&nbsp; Should the Russian
Government refuse to permit the work to be proceeded with, Borrow
was to occupy himself in assisting the Rev. Wm. Swan to
transcribe and collate the manuscript of the Old Testament in
Manchu that had recently come to light.&nbsp; At the same time,
he was to seize every opportunity that presented itself of
perfecting himself in Manchu.&nbsp; For this he was to receive a
salary of two hundred pounds a year to cover all expenses, save
those of the journey to and from St Petersburg, for which the
Society was to be responsible.&nbsp; Borrow was advised to think
carefully over the proposal, and, if it should prove attractive
to him, to hold himself in readiness to start as soon as the
General Committee should approve of the recommendation that was
to be placed before it.&nbsp; In conclusion, Mr Jowett proceeded
to administer a gentle rebuke to the confident pride with which
the candidate indited his letters.&nbsp; Only a quotation can
show the tact with which the admonition was conveyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; wrote the Literary Superintendent,
&ldquo;if as a clergyman, and your senior in years though not in
talent, I venture, with the kindest of motives, to throw out a
hint which may not be without its use.&nbsp; I am sure you will
not be offended if I suggest that there is occasionally a tone of
confidence in speaking of yourself, which has alarmed some of the
excellent members of our Committee.&nbsp; It may have been this
feeling, more than once displayed before, which prepared one or
two of them to stumble at an expression in your letter of
yesterday, in which, till pointed out, I confess I was not struck
with anything objectionable, but at which, nevertheless, a humble
Christian might not unreasonably take umbrage.&nbsp; It is where
you speak of the prospect of becoming &lsquo;useful to the Deity,
to man, and to yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Doubtless you meant the
prospect of glorifying God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had yet to learn the idiom of Earl Street, which he
showed himself most anxious to acquire.&nbsp; He clearly
recognised that the Bible Society required different treatment
from the Army Pay Office, or the Solicitor of the Treasury.&nbsp;
It was accustomed to humility in those it employed, and a trust
in a higher power, and Borrow&rsquo;s self-confident letters
alarmed the members of the Committee.&nbsp; How thoroughly Borrow
appreciated what was required is shown in a letter that he wrote
to his mother from Russia, when anticipating the return of his
brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should John return home,&rdquo; he warns
her, &ldquo;by no means let him go near the Bible Society, for he
would not do for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s reply to the Literary Superintendent&rsquo;s
kindly worded admonition was entirely satisfactory and &ldquo;in
harmony with the rule laid down by Christ himself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was something of a triumph, too, for Mr Jowett to rebuke a man
of such sensitiveness as Borrow, without goading him to an
impatient retort.</p>
<p>The meeting of the General Committee that was to decide upon
Borrow&rsquo;s future was held on 22nd July, and on the following
day Mr Jowett informed him that the recommendation of the
Sub-Committee had been adopted and confirmed, at the same time
requesting him to be at Earl Street on the morning of Friday,
26th July, that he might set out for St Petersburg the following
Tuesday.&nbsp; On 25th July Borrow took the night coach to
London.&nbsp; On the 29th he appeared before the Editorial
Sub-Committee and heard read the resolution of his appointment,
and drafts of letters recommending him to the Rev. Wm. Swan and
Dr I. J. Schmidt, a correspondent of the Society&rsquo;s in St
Petersburg and a member of the Russian Board of Censors.&nbsp;
Finally, there was impressed upon him &ldquo;the necessity of
confining himself closely to the one object of his mission,
carefully abstaining from mingling himself with political or
ecclesiastical affairs during his residence in Russia.&nbsp; Mr
Borrow assured them of his full determination religiously to
comply with this admonition, and to use every prudent method for
enlarging his acquaintance with the Manchu language.&rdquo; <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>The salary was to date from the day he embarked, and on
account of expenses to St Petersburg he drew the sum of
&pound;37.&nbsp; The actual amount he expended was &pound;27, 7s.
6d., according to the account he submitted, which was dated 2nd
October 1834.&nbsp; It is to be feared that Borrow was not very
punctual in rendering his accounts, as Mr Brandram wrote to him
(18th October 1837):&mdash;&ldquo;I know you are no accountant,
but do not forget that there are some who are.&nbsp; My memory
was jogged upon this subject the other day, and I was expected to
say to you that a letter of figures would be
acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not unnatural that those who remembered Borrow as one of
William Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;harum-scarum&rdquo; young men, who
at one time intended to &ldquo;abuse religion and get
prosecuted,&rdquo; should find in his appointment as an agent of
the British and Foreign Bible Society a subject for derisive
mirth.&nbsp; Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s voice was heard well above
the rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;When this polyglott gentleman appeared
before the public as a devout agent of the Bible Society in
foreign parts,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;there was one burst of
laughter from all who remembered the old Norwich days.&rdquo; <a
name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a>&nbsp; Like hundreds of other men,
Borrow had, in youth, been led to somewhat hasty and
ill-considered conclusions; but this in itself does not seem to
be sufficiently strong reason why he should not change his
views.&nbsp; Many young men pass through an aggressively
irreligious phase without suffering much harm.&nbsp; Harriet
Martineau was rather too precipitate in assuming that what a man
believes, or disbelieves, at twenty, he holds to at thirty; such
a view negatives the reformer.&nbsp; Perhaps the chief cause of
the change in Borrow&rsquo;s views was that he had touched the
depths of failure.&nbsp; Here was an opening that promised
much.&nbsp; He was a diplomatist when it suited his purpose, and
if the old poison were not quite gone out of his system, he would
hide his wounds, or allow the secretaries to bandage them with
mild reproof.</p>
<p>Very different from the attitude of Harriet Martineau was that
of John Venning, an English merchant resident at Norwich and
recently returned from St Petersburg, where his charity and
probity had placed him in high favour with the Emperor and the
Goverment officials.&nbsp; Mr Venning gave Borrow letters of
introduction to a number of influential personages at St
Petersburg, including Prince Alexander Galitzin and Baron
Schilling de Canstadt.&nbsp; Dr Bowring obtained a letter from
Lord Palmerston to someone whose name is not known.&nbsp; There
were letters of introduction from other hands, so that when he
was ready to sail Borrow found himself &ldquo;loaded with letters
of recommendation to some of the first people in Russia.&nbsp; Mr
Venning&rsquo;s packet has arrived with letters to several of the
Princes, so that I shall be protected if I am seized as a spy;
for the Emperor is particularly cautious as to the foreigners
whom he admits.&nbsp; It costs &pound;2, 7s. 6d. merely for
permission to go to Russia, which alone is enough to deter most
people.&rdquo; <a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a></p>
<p>Before leaving England, Borrow paid into his mother&rsquo;s
account at her bank the sum of seventeen pounds, an amount that
she had advanced to him either during his unproductive years, or
on account of his expenses in connection with the expedition to
St Petersburg.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
AUGUST 1833&ndash;JANUARY 1834</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> 19th/31st July 1833 Borrow set
out on a journey that was to some extent to realise his
ambitions.&nbsp; He was to be trusted and encouraged and, what
was most important of all, praised for what he accomplished; for
Borrow&rsquo;s was a nature that responded best to the praise and
entire confidence of those for whom he worked.</p>
<p>Travelling second class for reasons of economy, he landed at
Hamburg at seven in the morning of the fourth day, after having
experienced &ldquo;a disagreeable passage of three days, in which
I suffered much from sea-sickness.&rdquo; <a
name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a>&nbsp; Exhausted by these days of
suffering and want of sleep, the heat of the sun brought on
&ldquo;a transient fit of delirium,&rdquo; <a
name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b"
class="citation">[107b]</a> in other words, an attack of the
&ldquo;Horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two fellow-passengers (Jews), with
whom he had become acquainted, conveyed him to a comfortable
hotel, where he was visited by a physician, who administered
forty drops of laudanum, caused his head to be swathed in wet
towels, ordered him to bed, and charged a fee of seven
shillings.&nbsp; The result was that by the evening he had quite
recovered.</p>
<p>One of Borrow&rsquo;s first duties was to write a lengthy
letter to Mr Jowett, telling him of his movements, describing the
city, the service at a church he attended, the lax morality of
the Hamburgers in permitting rope-dancers in the park, and the
opening of dancing-saloons, &ldquo;most infamous places,&rdquo;
on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; &ldquo;England, with all her
faults,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;has still some regard to
decency, and will not tolerate such a shameless display of vice
on so sacred a season, when a decent cheerfulness is the freest
form in which the mind or countenance ought to invest
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; In conclusion, he announced his
intention of leaving for L&uuml;beck on the sixth, <a
name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> and he would be on the Baltic two
days later en route for St Petersburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;My next
letter, provided it pleases the Almighty to vouchsafe me a happy
arrival, will be from the Russian capital.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
&ldquo;a fervent request that you will not forget me in your
prayers,&rdquo; he demonstrated that Mr Jowett&rsquo;s hint had
not been forgotten.</p>
<p>The distance between Hamburg and L&uuml;beck is only about
thirty miles, yet it occupied Borrow thirteen hours, so
abominable was the road, which &ldquo;was paved at intervals with
huge masses of unhewn rock, and over this pavement the carriage
was very prudently driven at a snail&rsquo;s pace; for, had
anything approaching speed been attempted, the entire demolition
of the wheels in a few minutes must have been the necessary
result.&nbsp; No sooner had we quitted this terrible pavement
than we sank to our axle-trees in sand, mud, and water; for, to
render the journey perfectly delectable, the rain fell in
torrents and ceaselessly.&rdquo; <a name="citation108b"></a><a
href="#footnote108b" class="citation">[108b]</a>&nbsp; The state
of the road Borrow attributed to the ill-nature of the King of
Denmark, for immediately on leaving his dominions it improved
into an excellent carriageway.</p>
<p>On 28th July/9th August Borrow took steamer from
Travem&uuml;nde, and three days later landed at St
Petersburg.&nbsp; His first duty was to call upon Mr Swan, whom
he found &ldquo;one of the most amiable and interesting
characters&rdquo; he had ever met.&nbsp; The arrival of a
coadjutor caused Mr Swan considerable relief, as he had suffered
in health in consequence of his uninterrupted labours in
transcribing the Manchu manuscript.</p>
<p>Borrow was enthusiastic in his admiration of the capital of
&ldquo;our dear and glorious Russia.&rdquo;&nbsp; St Petersburg
he considered &ldquo;the finest city in the world&rdquo; <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a> other European capitals were unworthy
of comparison.&nbsp; The enormous palaces, the long, straight
streets, the grandeur of the public buildings, the noble Neva
that flows majestically through &ldquo;this Queen of the
cities,&rdquo; the three miles long Nevsky Prospect, paved with
wood; all aroused in him enthusiasm and admiration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; he wrote to his mother, &ldquo;I can do
little else but look and wonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that he had
read and heard of the capital of All the Russias had failed to
prepare him for this scene of splendour.&nbsp; The meeting and
harmonious mixing of East and West early attracted his
attention.&nbsp; The Oriental cultivation of a twelve-inch beard
among the middle and lower classes, placed them in marked
contrast with the moustached or clean-shaven patricians and
foreigners.&nbsp; In short, Russia gripped hold of and warmed
Borrow&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; Here were new types, curious
blendings of nationalities unthought of and strange to him, a
mine of wealth to a man whose studies were never books, except
when they helped him the better to understand men.</p>
<p>Another thing that attracted him to Russia was the great
kindness with which he was received, both by the English Colony
and the natives: to the one he appealed by virtue of a common
ancestry; to the other, on account of his knowledge of the
Russian tongue, not to speak of his mission, which acted as a
strong recommendation to their favour.&nbsp; On his part Borrow
reciprocated the esteem.&nbsp; If he were an implacable enemy, he
was also a good friend, and he thoroughly appreciated the manner
in which he was welcomed by his countrymen, especially the
invitation he received from one of them to make his house his
home until he found a suitable dwelling.&nbsp; To his mother he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Russians are the best-natured, kindest
people in the world, and though they do not know as much as the
English [he was not referring to the Colony], they have not their
fiendish, spiteful dispositions, and if you go amongst them and
speak their language, however badly, they would go through fire
and water to do you a kindness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later, when in
Portugal, he heartily wished himself &ldquo;back in Russia . . .
where I had left cherished friends and warm
affections.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High as was his opinion of the Russians, he was at a loss to
understand how they had earned their reputation as &ldquo;the
best general linguists in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found
Russian absolutely necessary to anyone who wished to make himself
understood.&nbsp; French and German as equivalents were of less
value in St Petersburg than in England.</p>
<p>At first Borrow took up his residence &ldquo;for nearly a
fortnight in a hotel, as the difficulty of procuring lodgings in
this place is very great, and when you have procured them you
have to furnish them yourself at a considerable expense . . .
eventually I took up my abode with Mr Egerton Hubbard, a friend
of Mr Venning&rsquo;s [at 221 Galernoy Ulitza], where I am for
the present very comfortably situated.&rdquo; <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; He stayed with Mr Hubbard for
three months; but was eventually forced to leave on account of
constant interruptions, probably by his fellow-boarders, in
consequence of which he could neither perform his task of
transcription nor devote himself to study.&nbsp; He therefore
took a small lodging at a cost of nine shillings a week,
including fires, where he could enjoy quiet and solitude.&nbsp;
His meals he got at a Russian eating-house, dinner costing
fivepence, &ldquo;consequently,&rdquo; he writes to his mother,
&ldquo;I am not at much expense, being able to live for about
sixty pounds a year and pay a Russian teacher, who has five
shillings for one lesson a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Borrow&rsquo;s earliest thoughts on arriving at St
Petersburg had been to present his letters of introduction.&nbsp;
Within two days of landing he called upon Prince Alexander
Gal&iacute;tzin, <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> accompanied by his fellow-lodger,
young Venning.&nbsp; One of the most important, and at the same
time useful, friendships that he made was with Baron Schilling de
Canstadt, the philologist and savant, who, later, with his
accustomed generosity, was to place his unique library at
Borrow&rsquo;s disposition.&nbsp; The Baron was one of the
greatest bibliophiles of his age, and possessed a collection of
Eastern manuscripts and other priceless treasures that was
world-famous.&nbsp; He spared neither expense nor trouble in
procuring additions to his collection, which after his death was
acquired by the Imperial Academy of Science at St
Petersburg.&nbsp; In this literary treasure-house Borrow found
facilities for study such as he nowhere else could hope to
obtain.</p>
<p>Another friendship that Borrow made was with John P. Hasfeldt,
a man of about his own age attached to the Danish Legation, who
also gave lessons in languages.&nbsp; Borrow seems to have been
greatly attracted to Hasfeldt, who wrote to him with such
cordiality.&nbsp; It was Hasfeldt who gave to Borrow as a parting
gift the silver shekel that he invariably carried about with him,
and which caused him to be hailed as blessed by the Gibraltar
Jews.</p>
<p>In his letter Hasfeldt shows himself a delightful
correspondent.&nbsp; His generous camaraderie seemed to warm
Borrow to response, as indeed well it might.&nbsp; Who could
resist the breezy good humour of the following from a letter
addressed to Borrow by Hasfeldt years later?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do you still eat Pike soup?&nbsp; Do you
remember the time when you lived on that dish for more than six
weeks, and came near exterminating the whole breed?&nbsp; And the
pudding that accompanied it, that always lay as hard as a stone
on the stomach?&nbsp; This you surely have not forgotten.&nbsp;
Yes, your kitchen was delicately manipulated by Machmoud, your
Tartar servant, who only needed to give you horse-meat to have
merited a diploma.&nbsp; Do you still sing when you are in a good
humour?&nbsp; Doubtless you are not troubled with many friends to
visit you, for you are not of the sort who are easily understood,
nor do you care to have everyone understand you; you prefer to
have people call you grey and let you gae.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other friends Borrow made, including Nikolai Iv&aacute;novitch
Gretch, <a name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a> the grammarian, and Friedrich von
Adelung, <a name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a> who assisted him with the loan of
books and MSS. in Oriental tongues.</p>
<p>The story of Borrow&rsquo;s labours in connection with the
printing of the Manchu version of the New Testament, forms a
remarkable study of unswerving courage and will-power triumphing
over apparently insurmountable obstacles.&nbsp; The mere presence
of difficulties seemed to increase his eagerness and
determination to overcome them.&nbsp; Disappointments he had in
plenty; but his indomitable courage and untiring energy, backed
up by the earnest support he received from Earl Street, enabled
him to emerge from his first serious undertaking with the
knowledge that he had succeeded where failure would not have been
discreditable.</p>
<p>He threw himself into his work with characteristic
eagerness.&nbsp; At the end of the first two months he had
transcribed the Second Book of Chronicles and the Gospel of St
Matthew.&nbsp; He formed a very high opinion of the work of the
translator, and took the opportunity of paying a tribute to the
followers of Ignatius Loyola (Father Puerot was a Jesuit).&nbsp;
&ldquo;When,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;did a Jesuit any thing
which he undertook, whether laudable or the reverse, not far
better than any other person?&rdquo; yet they laboured in vain,
for &ldquo;they thought not of His glory, but of the glory of
their order.&rdquo; <a name="citation113"></a><a
href="#footnote113" class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<p>Borrow discovered that Mr Lipovzoff knew nothing of the Bible
Society&rsquo;s scheme for printing the New Testament in Manchu;
but he found, what was of even greater importance to him, that
the old man knew no European language but Russian.&nbsp; Thus the
frequent conversations and explanations all tended to improve
Borrow&rsquo;s knowledge of the language of the people among whom
he was living.</p>
<p>Mr Lipovzoff struck Borrow as being &ldquo;rather a singular
man,&rdquo; as he took occasion to inform Mr Jowett, apparently
utterly indifferent as to the fate of his translation, excellent
though it was.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Mr Lipovzoff was
occupied with his own concerns, and, as an official in the
Russian Foreign Office, most likely saw the inexpediency of a too
eager enthusiasm for the Bible Society&rsquo;s Manchu-Tartar
programme.&nbsp; He was probably bewildered by the fierce energy
of its honest and compelling agent, who had descended upon St
Petersburg to do the Society&rsquo;s bidding with an impetuosity
and determination foreign to Russian official life.&nbsp; Borrow
was on fire with zeal and impatient of the apathy of those around
him.</p>
<p>He soon began to show signs of that singleness of purpose and
resourcefulness that, later, was to arouse so much enthusiasm
among the members of the Bible Society at home.&nbsp; The
transcribing and collating Puerot&rsquo;s version of the
Scriptures occupied the remainder of the year.&nbsp; On the
completion of this work, it had been arranged that Mr Swan should
return to his mission-station in Siberia.&nbsp; The next step was
to obtain official sanction to print the Lipovzoff version of the
New Testament.&nbsp; Dr Schmidt, to whom Borrow turned for advice
and information, was apparently very busily occupied with his own
affairs, which included the compilation of a Mongolian Grammar
and Dictionary.&nbsp; The Doctor was optimistic, and promised to
make enquiries about the steps to be taken to obtain the
necessary permission to print; but Borrow heard nothing further
from him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus circumstanced, and being very uneasy
in my mind,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I determined to take a bold
step, and directly and without further feeling my way, to
petition the Government in my own name for permission to print
the Manchu Scriptures.&nbsp; Having communicated this
determination to our beloved, sincere, and most truly Christian
friend Mr Swan (who has lately departed to his station in
Siberia, shielded I trust by the arm of his Master), it met with
his perfect approbation and cordial encouragement.&nbsp; I
therefore drew up a petition, and presented it with my own hand
to His Excellence Mr Bludoff, Minister of the Interior.&rdquo; <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minister made reply that he doubted his jurisdiction in
the matter; but that he would consider.&nbsp; Fearful lest the
matter should miscarry or be shelved, Borrow called on the
evening of the same day upon the British Minister, the Hon. J. D.
Bligh, &ldquo;a person of superb talents, kind disposition, and
of much piety,&rdquo; <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a> whose friendship
Borrow had &ldquo;assiduously cultivated,&rdquo; and who had
shown him &ldquo;many condescending marks of kindness.&rdquo; <a
name="citation114c"></a><a href="#footnote114c"
class="citation">[114c]</a>&nbsp; But Mr Bligh was out.&nbsp;
Nothing daunted, Borrow wrote a note entreating his interest with
the Russian officials.&nbsp; On calling for an answer in the
morning, he was received by Mr Bligh, when &ldquo;he was kind
enough to say that if I desired it he would apply officially to
the Minister, and exert all his influence in his official
character in order to obtain the accomplishment of my views, but
at the same time suggested that it would, perhaps, be as well at
a private interview to beg it as a personal favour.&rdquo; <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a></p>
<p>There was hesitation, perhaps suspicion, in official
quarters.&nbsp; It is easy to realise that the Government was not
eager to assist the agent of an institution closely allied to the
Russian Bible Society, which it had recently been successful in
suppressing.&nbsp; It might with impunity suppress a Society; but
in George Borrow it soon became evident that the officials had to
deal with a man of purpose and determination who used a British
Minister as a two-edged sword.&nbsp; Borrow was invited to call
at the Asiatic Department: he did so, and learned that if
permission were granted, Mr Lipovzoff (who was a clerk in the
Department) was to be censor (over his own translation!) and
Borrow editor.&nbsp; There was still the &ldquo;If.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow waited a fortnight, then called on Mr Bligh.&nbsp; By
great good chance Mr Bludoff was dining that evening with the
British Minister.&nbsp; The same night Borrow received a message
requesting him to call on Mr Bludoff the next day.&nbsp; On
presenting himself he was given a letter to the Director of
Worship, which he delivered without delay, and was told to call
again on the first day of the following week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On calling there <i>I found that permission had been
granted to print the Manchu Scripture</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b"
class="citation">[115b]</a>&nbsp; Baron Schilling had rendered
some assistance in getting the permission, and Borrow was
requested to inform him of &ldquo;the deep sense of
obligation&rdquo; of the Bible Society, to which was added a
present of some books.</p>
<p>Borrow clearly viewed this as only a preliminary success; he
had in mind the eventual printing of the whole Bible.&nbsp; He
was beginning to feel conscious of his own powers.&nbsp; Mr Swan
had gone, and upon Borrow&rsquo;s shoulders rested the whole
enterprise.&nbsp; A mild wave of enthusiasm passed over the Head
Office at Earl Street on receipt of the news that permission to
print had been obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot conceive,&rdquo; Borrow wrote to Mr Jowett,
&ldquo;the cold, heartless apathy in respect to the affair, on
which I have been despatched hither as an <i>assistant</i>, which
I have found in people to whom I looked not unreasonably for
encouragement and advice.&rdquo; <a name="citation116"></a><a
href="#footnote116" class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; Well might
he underline the word &ldquo;assistant.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this same
letter, with a spasmodic flicker of the old self-confidence, he
adds, &ldquo;In regard to what we have yet to do, let it be borne
in mind, that we are by no means dependent upon Mr Lipovzoff,
though certainly to secure the services, which he is capable of
performing, would be highly desirable, and though he cannot act
outwardly in the character of Editor (he having been appointed
censor), he may privately be of great utility to us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow seems to have formed no very high opinion of Mr
Lipovzoff&rsquo;s capacity for affairs, although he recognised
his skill as a translator.</p>
<p>At first Borrow seems to have found the severity of the winter
very trying.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cold when you go out into
it,&rdquo; he writes to his mother (1st/13th Feb. 1834),
&ldquo;cuts your face like a razor, and were you not to cover it
with furs the flesh would be bitten off.&nbsp; The rooms in the
morning are heated with a stove as hot as ovens, and you would
not be able to exist in one for a minute; but I have become used
to them and like them much, though at first they made me
dreadfully sick and brought on bilious headaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was still at the Sarepta House, the premises of the
Bible Society&rsquo;s bankers in St Petersburg, the box of Manchu
type, which had not been examined since the river floods.&nbsp;
In addition to this, the only other Manchu characters in St
Petersburg belonged to Baron Schilling, who possessed a small
fount of the type, which he used &ldquo;for the convenience of
printing trifles in that tongue,&rdquo; as Borrow phrased
it.&nbsp; This was to be put at Borrow&rsquo;s disposal if
necessary; but first the type at the Sarepta House had to be
examined.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s plan was, provided the type were
not entirely ruined, to engage the services of a printer who was
accustomed to setting Mongolian characters, which are very
similar to those of Manchu, who would, he thought, be competent
to undertake the work.&nbsp; He suggested following the style of
the St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel already printed, giving to each
Gospel and the Acts a volume and printing the Epistles and the
Apocalypse in three more, making eight volumes in all.</p>
<p>These he proposed putting &ldquo;in a small thin wooden case,
covered with blue stuff, precisely after the manner of Chinese
books, in order that they may not give offence to the eyes of the
people for whom they are intended by a foreign and unusual
appearance, for the mere idea that they are barbarian books would
certainly prevent them being read, and probably cause their
destruction if ever they found their way into the Chinese
Empire.&rdquo; <a name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a>&nbsp; Borrow left nothing to chance;
he thought out every detail with great care before venturing to
put his plans into execution.</p>
<p>Although busily occupied in an endeavour to stimulate Russian
government officials to energy and decision, Borrow was not
neglecting what had been so strongly urged upon him, the
perfecting of himself in the Manchu dialect.&nbsp; In reply to an
enquiry from Mr Jowett as to what manner of progress he was
making, he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For some time past I have taken lessons
from a person who was twelve years in Pekin, and who speaks
Manchu and Chinese with fluency.&nbsp; I pay him about six
shillings English for each lesson, which I grudge not, for the
perfect acquirement of Manchu is one of my most ardent
wishes.&rdquo; <a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This person Borrow subsequently recommended to the Society
&ldquo;to assist me in making a translation into Manchu of the
Psalms and Isaiah,&rdquo; but the pundit proved &ldquo;of no
utility at all, but only the cause of error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was soon able to transcribe the Manchu characters with
greater facility and speed than he could English.&nbsp; In
addition to being able to translate from and into Manchu, he
could compose hymns in the language, and even prepared a Manchu
rendering of the second Homily of the Church of England,
&ldquo;On the Misery of Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, however, made
the discovery that Manchu was far less easy to him than it had at
first appeared, and that Amyot was to some extent justified in
his view of the difficulties it presented.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is one
of those deceitful tongues,&rdquo; he confesses in a letter to Mr
Jowett, &ldquo;the seeming simplicity of whose structure induces
you to suppose, after applying to it for a month or two, that
little more remains to be learned, but which, should you continue
to study a year, as I have studied this, show themselves to you
in their veritable colours, amazing you with their copiousness,
puzzling with their idioms.&rdquo;<a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a>&nbsp; Its
difficulties, however, did not discourage him; for he had a great
admiration for the language which &ldquo;for majesty and grandeur
of sound, and also for general copiousness is unequalled by any
existing tongue.&rdquo; <a name="citation118c"></a><a
href="#footnote118c" class="citation">[118c]</a></p>
<p>However great his exertions or discouragements, Borrow never
forgot his mother, to whom he was a model son.&nbsp; On 1st/13th
February he sent her a draft for twenty pounds, being the second
since his arrival six months previously.&nbsp; Thus out of his
first half-year&rsquo;s salary of a hundred pounds, he sent to
his mother forty pounds (in addition to the seventeen pounds he
had paid into her account before sailing), and with it a promise
that &ldquo;next quarter I shall try and send you thirty,&rdquo;
lest in the recent storms of which he had heard, some of her
property should have suffered damage and be in need of
repair.&nbsp; The larger remittance, however, he was unable to
make on account of the illness that had necessitated the drinking
of a bottle of port wine each day (by doctor&rsquo;s orders); but
he was punctual in remitting the twenty pounds.&nbsp; The attack
which required so drastic a remedy originated in a chill caught
as the ice was breaking up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went mad,&rdquo; he
tells his mother, &ldquo;and when the fever subsided, I was
seized with the &lsquo;Horrors,&rsquo; which never left me day or
night for a week.&rdquo; <a name="citation119"></a><a
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a>&nbsp; During this
illness everyone seems to have been extremely kind and attentive,
the Emperor&rsquo;s apothecary, even, sending word that Borrow
was to order of him anything, medical or otherwise, that he found
himself in need of.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
FEBRUARY&ndash;OCTOBER 1834</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> had at last found work that
was thoroughly congenial to him.&nbsp; It was not in his nature
to exist outside his occupations, and his whole personality
became bound up in the mission upon which he was engaged.&nbsp;
Not content with preparing the way for printing the New Testament
in Manchu, he set himself the problem of how it was to be
distributed when printed.&nbsp; He foresaw serious obstacles to
its introduction into China, on account of the suspicion with
which was regarded any and everything European.&nbsp; With a
modest disclaimer that his suggestion arose &ldquo;from a
plenitude of self-conceit and a disposition to offer advice upon
all matters, however far they may be above my
understanding,&rdquo; he proceeds to deal with the difficulties
of distribution with great clearness.</p>
<p>To send the printed books to Canton, to be distributed by
English missionaries, he thought would be productive of very
little good, nor would it achieve the object of the Society, to
distribute copies at seaports along the coasts, because it was
unlikely that there would be many Tartars or people there who
understood Manchu.&nbsp; There was a further obstacle in the
suspicion in which the Chinese held all things English.&nbsp; On
the other hand, he tells Mr Jowett,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;there is a most admirable opening for the
work on the Russian side of the Chinese Empire.&nbsp; About five
thousand miles from St Petersburg, on the frontiers of Chinese
Tartary, and only nine hundred miles distant from Pekin, the seat
of the Tartar Monarchy, stands the town of Kiakhta, <a
name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a> which properly belongs to Russia, but
the inhabitants of which are a medley of Tartary, Chinese, and
Russ (<i>sic</i>).&nbsp; As far as this town a Russian or
foreigner is permitted to advance, but his further progress is
forbidden, and if he make the attempt he is liable to be taken up
as a spy or deserter, and sent back under guard.&nbsp; This town
is the emporium of Chinese and Russian trade.&nbsp; Chinese
caravans are continually arriving and returning, bringing and
carrying away articles of merchandise.&nbsp; There are likewise a
Chinese and a Tartar Mandarin, also a school where Chinese and
Tartar are taught, and where Chinese and Tartar children along
with Russian are educated.&rdquo; <a name="citation121b"></a><a
href="#footnote121b" class="citation">[121b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advantages of such a town as a base of operations were
obvious.&nbsp; Borrow was convinced that he could dispose
&ldquo;of any quantity of Testaments to the Chinese merchants who
arrive thither from Pekin and other places, and who would be glad
to purchase them on speculation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation121c"></a><a href="#footnote121c"
class="citation">[121c]</a></p>
<p>Russia and China were friendly to each other, so much so, that
there was at Pekin a Russian mission, the only one of its
kind.&nbsp; These good relations rendered Borrow confident that
books from Russia, especially books which had not an outlandish
appearance, would be purchased without scruple.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a
word, were an agent for the Bible Society to reside at this town
[Kiakhta] for a year or so, it is my humble opinion, and the
opinion of much wiser people, that if he were active, zealous and
likewise courageous, the blessings resulting from his labours
would be incalculable.&rdquo; <a name="citation121d"></a><a
href="#footnote121d" class="citation">[121d]</a></p>
<p>He might even make excursions into Tartary, and become
friendly with the inhabitants, and eventually perhaps,
&ldquo;with a little management and dexterity,&rdquo; he might
&ldquo;penetrate even to Pekin, and return in safety, after
having examined the state of the land.&nbsp; I can only say that
if it were my fortune to have the opportunity, I would make the
attempt, and should consider myself only to blame if I did not
succeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was to revert to this suggestion on
many occasions, in fact it seems to have been in his mind during
the whole period of his association with the Bible Society.</p>
<p>Acting upon instructions from Earl Street, Borrow proceeded to
find out the approximate cost of printing the Manchu New
Testament.&nbsp; He early discovered that in Russia &ldquo;the
wisdom of the serpent is quite as necessary as the innocence of
the dove,&rdquo; as he took occasion to inform Mr Jowett.&nbsp;
The Russians rendered him estimates of cost as if of the opinion
that &ldquo;Englishmen are made of gold, and that it is only
necessary to ask the most extravagant price for any article in
order to obtain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In St Petersburg Borrow was taken for a German, a nation for
which he cherished a cordial dislike.&nbsp; This mistake as to
nationality, however, did not hinder the Russian tradesmen from
asking exorbitant prices for their services or their goods.&nbsp;
At first Borrow &ldquo;was quite terrified at the enormous sums
which some of the printers . . . required for the
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length he applied to the University Press,
which asked 30 roubles 60 copecks (24s. 8d.) per sheet of two
pages for composition and printing.&nbsp; A young firm of German
printers, Schultz &amp; Beneze, was, however, willing to
undertake the same work at the rate of 12.5 roubles (10s.) per
two sheets.</p>
<p>In contracting for the paper Borrow showed himself quite equal
to the commercial finesse of the Russian.&nbsp; He scoured the
neighbourhood round St Petersburg in a calash at a cost of about
four pounds.&nbsp; Russian methods of conducting business are
amazing to the English mind.&nbsp; At Peterhof, a town about
twenty miles out of St Petersburg, he found fifty reams of a
paper such as he required.&nbsp; &ldquo;Concerning the price of
this paper,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I could obtain no positive
information, for the Director and first and second clerks were
invariably absent, and the place abandoned to ignorant
understrappers (according to the custom of Russia).&nbsp; And
notwithstanding I found out the Director in St Petersburg, he
himself could not tell me the price.&rdquo; <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a></p>
<p>Eventually 75 roubles (&pound;3) a ream was quoted for the
stock, and 100 roubles (&pound;4) a ream for any further quantity
required.&nbsp; Thus the paper for a thousand copies would run to
40,000 roubles (&pound;1600), or 32s. a copy.&nbsp; Borrow found
that the law of commerce prevalent in the East was that adopted
in St Petersburg.&nbsp; A price is named merely as a basis of
negotiation, and the customer beats it down to a figure that
suits him, or he goes elsewhere.&nbsp; Borrow was a master of
such methods.&nbsp; The sum he eventually paid for the paper was
25 roubles (&pound;1) a ream!&nbsp; Of all these negotiations he
kept Mr Jowett well informed.&nbsp; By June he had received from
Earl Street the official sanction to proceed, together with a
handsome remittance.</p>
<p>For some time past Borrow had been anxious on account of his
brother John.&nbsp; On 9th/21st November, he had written to his
mother telling her to write to John urging him to come home at
once, as he had seen in the Russian newspapers how the town of
Guanajuato had been taken and sacked by the rebels, and also that
cholera was ravaging Mexico.&nbsp; Later <a
name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> he tells her of that nice house at
Lakenham, <a name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c"
class="citation">[123c]</a> which he means to buy, and how John
can keep a boat and amuse himself on the river, and adds,
&ldquo;I dare say I shall continue for a long time with the Bible
Society, as they see that I am useful to them and can be depended
upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the day following that on which Borrow wrote asking his
mother to urge his brother to return home, viz., 10th/22nd
November, John died.&nbsp; He was taken ill suddenly in the
morning and passed away the same afternoon.</p>
<p>In February 1832 John Borrow had, much against the advice of
his friends, left the United Mexican Company, which he had become
associated with the previous year.&nbsp; He was of a restless
disposition, never content with what he was doing.&nbsp; Thinking
he could better himself, and having saved a few hundred dollars,
he resigned his post.&nbsp; He appears soon to have discovered
his mistake.&nbsp; First he indulged in an unfortunate
speculation, by which he was a considerable loser, then cholera
broke out.&nbsp; Without a thought of himself he turned nurse and
doctor, witnessing terrible scenes of misery and death and
ministering to the poor with an energy and humanity that earned
for him the admiration of the whole township.&nbsp; Finally,
finding himself in serious financial difficulties, he entered the
service of the Colombian Mining Company, and was to be sent to
Colombia &ldquo;for the purpose of introducing the Mexican system
of beneficiating there.&rdquo;&nbsp; It only remained for the
agreement to be signed, when he was taken ill.</p>
<p>In the letter in which she tells George of their loss, Mrs
Borrow expresses fear that he does &ldquo;not live regular.&nbsp;
When you find yourself low,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;take a
little wine, but not too much at one time; it will do you the
more good; I find that by myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her solicitude for
George&rsquo;s health is easily understandable.&nbsp; He is now
her &ldquo;only hope,&rdquo; as she pathetically tells him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do not grieve, my dear George,&rdquo; she proceeds
tenderly, &ldquo;I trust we shall all meet in heaven.&nbsp; Put a
crape on your hat for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George wrote immediately to acknowledge his mother&rsquo;s
letter containing the news of John&rsquo;s death, which had given
him &ldquo;the severest stroke I ever experienced.&nbsp; It [the
letter] quite stunned me, and since reading its contents I have
done little else but moan and lament . . . O that our darling
John had taken the advice which I gave him nearly three years
since, to abandon that horrid country and return to England! . .
. Would that I had died for him! for I loved him dearly,
dearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s affection for his bright and
attractive brother is everywhere manifest in his writings.&nbsp;
He never showed the least jealousy when his father held up his
first-born as a model to the strange and incomprehensible younger
son.&nbsp; His love for and admiration of John were genuine and
deep-rooted.&nbsp; In the same letter he goes on to assure his
mother that he was never better in his life, and that experience
teaches him how to cure his disorders.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
&lsquo;Horrors,&rsquo; for example.&nbsp; Whenever they come I
must drink strong Port wine, and then they are stopped
instantly.&nbsp; But do not think that I drink habitually, for
you ought to know that I abhor drink.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Horrors&rsquo; are brought on by weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes on to reassure his mother as to the care he takes of
himself, telling her that he has three meals a day, although, as
a rule, dinner is a poor one, &ldquo;for the Russians, in the
first place, are very indifferent cooks, and the meat is very
bad, as in fact are almost all the provisions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
fish is without taste, Russian salmon having less savour than
English skate; the fowls are dry because no endeavour is made to
fatten them, and the &ldquo;mutton stinks worst than carrion, for
they never cut the wool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great thought and tenderness he tells her that he wishes
her &ldquo;to keep a maid, for I do not like that you should live
alone.&nbsp; Do not take one of the wretched girls of
Norwich,&rdquo; he advises her, but rather the daughter of one of
her tenants.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I working for here and saving
money, unless it is for your comfort? for I assure you that to
make you comfortable is my greatest happiness, almost my only
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Urging her to keep up her spirits and read much
of the things that interest her, he concludes with a warning to
her not to pay any debts contracted by John. <a
name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a"
class="citation">[126a]</a>&nbsp; The letter concludes with the
postscript: &ldquo;I have got the crape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July 1834 Borrow again changed his quarters, taking an
unfurnished floor, <a name="citation126b"></a><a
href="#footnote126b" class="citation">[126b]</a> at the same time
hiring a Tartar servant named Mahmoud, &ldquo;the best servant I
ever had.&rdquo; <a name="citation126c"></a><a
href="#footnote126c" class="citation">[126c]</a>&nbsp; The wages
he paid this prince of body-servants was thirty shillings a
month, out of which Mahmoud supplied himself &ldquo;with food and
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s reason for making this
change in his lodgings was that he wanted more room than he had,
and furnished apartments were very expensive.&nbsp; The actual
furnishing was not a very costly matter to a man of
Borrow&rsquo;s simple wants; for the expenditure of seven pounds
he provided himself with all he required.</p>
<p>After the letter of 27th June/9th July the Bible Society
received no further news of what was taking place in St
Petersburg.&nbsp; Week after week passed without anything being
heard of its Russian agent&rsquo;s movements or activities.&nbsp;
On 25th September/7th October Mr Jowett wrote an extremely
moderate letter beseeching Borrow to remember &ldquo;the very
lively interest&rdquo; taken by the General Committee in the
printing of the Manchu version of the New Testament; that people
were asking, &ldquo;What is Mr Borrow doing?&rdquo; that the
Committee stands between its agents and an eager public, desirous
of knowing the trials and tribulations, the hopes and fears of
those actively engaged in printing or disseminating the
Scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can have no difficulty,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;in furnishing me with such monthly information
as may satisfy the Committee that they are not expending a large
sum of money in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was also a request for
information as to how &ldquo;some critical difficulty has been
surmounted by the translator, or editor, or both united, not to
mention the advance already made in actual printing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On 1st/13th Oct. Borrow had written a brief letter giving an
account of his disbursements during the journey to St Petersburg
<i>fifteen months previously</i>; but he made no mention of what
was taking place with regard to the printing.</p>
<p>The letter in which Borrow replied to Mr Jowett is probably
the most remarkable he ever wrote.&nbsp; It presents him in a
light that must have astonished those who had been so eager to
ridicule his appointment as an agent of the Bible Society.&nbsp;
The letter runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">St
Petersburg</span>,<br />
8<i>th</i> [20<i>th</i>] <i>October</i> 1834.</p>
<p>I have just received your most kind epistle, the perusal of
which has given me both pain and pleasure&mdash;pain that from
unavoidable circumstances I have been unable to gratify eager
expectation, and pleasure that any individual should have been
considerate enough to foresee my situation and to make allowance
for it.&nbsp; The nature of my occupations during the last two
months and a half has been such as would have entirely unfitted
me for correspondence, had I been aware that it was necessary,
which, on my sacred word, I was not.&nbsp; Now, and only now,
when by the blessing of God I have surmounted all my troubles and
difficulties, I will tell, and were I not a Christian I should be
proud to tell, what I have been engaged upon and accomplished
during the last ten weeks.&nbsp; I have been working in the
printing-office, as a common compositor, between ten and thirteen
hours every day during that period; the result of this is that St
Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel, printed from such a copy as I believe
nothing was ever printed from before, has been brought out in the
Manchu language; two rude Esthonian peasants, who previously
could barely compose with decency in a plain language which they
spoke and were accustomed to, have received such instruction that
with ease they can each compose at the rate of a sheet a day in
the Manchu, perhaps the most difficult language for composition
in the whole world.&nbsp; Considerable progress has also been
made in St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, and I will venture to promise,
provided always the Almighty smiles upon the undertaking, that
the entire work of which I have the superintendence will be
published within eight months from the present time.&nbsp; Now,
therefore, with the premise that I most unwillingly speak of
myself and what I have done and suffered for some time past, all
of which I wished to keep locked up in my own breast, I will give
a regular and circumstantial account of my proceedings from the
day when I received your letter, by which I was authorised by the
Committee to bespeak paper, engage with a printer, and cause our
type to be set in order.</p>
<p>My first care was to endeavour to make suitable arrangements
for the obtaining of Chinese paper.&nbsp; Now those who reside in
England, the most civilised and blessed of countries, where
everything is to be obtained at a fair price, have not the
slightest idea of the anxiety and difficulty which, in a country
like this, harass the foreigner who has to disburse money not his
own, if he wish that his employers be not shamefully and
outrageously imposed upon.&nbsp; In my last epistle to you I
stated that I had been asked 100 roubles per ream for such paper
as we wanted.&nbsp; I likewise informed you that I believed that
it was possible to procure it for 35 roubles, notwithstanding our
Society had formerly paid 40 roubles for worse paper than the
samples I was in possession of.&nbsp; Now I have always been of
opinion that in the expending of money collected for sacred
purposes, it behoves the agent to be extraordinarily circumspect
and sparing.&nbsp; I therefore was determined, whatever trouble
it might cost me, to procure for the Society unexceptionable
paper at a yet more reasonable rate than 35 roubles.&nbsp; I was
aware that an acquaintance of mine, a young Dane, was
particularly intimate with one of the first printers of this
city, who is accustomed to purchase vast quantities of paper
every month for his various publications.&nbsp; I gave this young
gentleman a specimen of the paper I required, and desired him (he
was under obligations to me) to inquire of his friend, <i>as if
from curiosity</i>, the least possible sum per ream at which
<i>the printer himself</i> (who from his immense demand for paper
should necessarily obtain it cheaper than any one else) could
expect to purchase the article in question.&nbsp; The answer I
received within a day or two was 25 roubles.&nbsp; Upon hearing
this I prevailed upon my acquaintance to endeavour to persuade
his friend to bespeak the paper at 25 roubles, and to allow me,
notwithstanding I was a perfect stranger, to have it at that
price.&nbsp; All this was brought about.&nbsp; I was introduced
to the printer, Mr Pluchard, by the Dane, Mr Hasfeldt, and
between the former gentleman and myself a contract was made to
the effect that by the end of October he should supply me with
450 reams of Chinese paper at 25 roubles per ream, the first
delivery to be made on the 1st of August; for as my order given
at an advanced period of the year, when all the paper
manufactories were at full work towards the executing of orders
already received, it was but natural that I should verify the old
apophthegm, &lsquo;Last come, last served.&rsquo;&nbsp; As no
orders are attended to in Russia unless money be advanced upon
them, I deposited in the hands of Mr Pluchard the sum of 2000
roubles, receiving his receipt for that amount.</p>
<p>Having arranged this most important matter to my satisfaction,
I turned my attention to the printing process.&nbsp; I accepted
the offer of Messrs Schultz &amp; Beneze to compose and print the
Manchu Testament at the rate of 25 roubles per sheet [of four
pages], and caused our fount of type to be conveyed to their
office.&nbsp; I wish to say here a few words respecting the state
in which these types came into my possession.&nbsp; I found them
in a kind of warehouse, or rather cellar.&nbsp; They had been
originally confined in two cases; but these having burst, the
type lay on the floor trampled amidst mud and filth.&nbsp; They
were, moreover, not improved by having been immersed within the
waters of the inundation of &rsquo;27 [1824].&nbsp; I caused them
all to be collected and sent to their destination, where they
were purified and arranged&mdash;a work of no small time and
difficulty, at which I was obliged to assist.&nbsp; Not finding
with the type what is called &lsquo;Durchschuss&rsquo; by the
printers here, consisting of leaden wedges of about six ounces
weight each, which form the spaces between the lines, I ordered
120 pounds weight of those at a rouble a pound, being barely
enough for three sheets. <a name="citation129"></a><a
href="#footnote129" class="citation">[129]</a>&nbsp; I had now to
teach the compositors the Manchu alphabet, and to distinguish one
character from another.&nbsp; This occupied a few days, at the
end of which I gave them the commencement of St Matthew&rsquo;s
Gospel to copy.&nbsp; They no sooner saw the work they were
called upon to perform than there were loud murmurs of
dissatisfaction, and . . . &lsquo;It is quite impossible to do
the like,&rsquo; was the cry&mdash;and no wonder.&nbsp; The
original printed Gospel had been so interlined and scribbled upon
by the author, in a hand so obscure and irregular, that,
accustomed as I was to the perusal of the written Manchu, it was
not without the greatest difficulty that I could decipher the new
matter myself.&nbsp; Moreover, the corrections had been so
carelessly made that they themselves required far more correction
than the original matter.&nbsp; I was therefore obliged to be
continually in the printing-office, and to do three parts of the
work myself.&nbsp; For some time I found it necessary to select
every character with my own fingers, and to deliver it to the
compositor, and by so doing I learnt myself to compose.&nbsp; We
continued in this way till all our characters were exhausted, for
no paper had arrived.&nbsp; For two weeks and more we were
obliged to pause, the want of paper being insurmountable.&nbsp;
At the end of this period came six reams; but partly from the
manufacturers not being accustomed to make this species of paper,
and partly from the excessive heat of the weather, which caused
it to dry too fast, only one ream and a half could be used, and
this was not enough for one sheet; the rest I refused to take,
and sent back.&nbsp; The next week came fifteen reams.&nbsp; This
paper, from the same causes, was as bad as the last.&nbsp; I
selected four reams, and sent the rest back.&nbsp; But this paper
enabled us to make a beginning, which we did not fail to do,
though we received no more for upwards of a fortnight, which
caused another pause.&nbsp; At the end of that time, owing to my
pressing remonstrances and entreaties, a regular supply of about
twelve reams per week of most excellent paper commenced.&nbsp;
This continued until we had composed the last five sheets of St
Matthew, when some paper arrived, which in my absence was
received by Mr Beneze, who, without examining it, as was his
duty, delivered it to the printers to use in the printing of the
said sheets, who accordingly printed upon part of it.&nbsp; But
the next day, when my occupation permitted me to see what they
were about, I observed that the last paper was of a quality very
different from that which had been previously sent.&nbsp; I
accordingly instantly stopped the press, and, notwithstanding
eight reams had been printed upon, I sent all the strange paper
back, and caused Mr Beneze to recompose three sheets, which had
been broken up, at his own expense.&nbsp; But this caused the
delay of another week.</p>
<p>This last circumstance made me determine not to depend in
future for paper on one manufactory alone.&nbsp; I therefore
stated to Mr P[luchard] that, as his people were unable to
furnish me with the article fast enough, I should apply to others
for 250 reams, and begged him to supply me with the rest as fast
as possible.&nbsp; He made no objection.&nbsp; Thereupon I
prevailed upon my most excellent friend, Baron Schilling, to
speak to his acquaintance, State-Councillor Alquin, who is
possessed of a paper-factory, on the subject.&nbsp; M. Alquin, as
a personal favour to Baron Schilling (whom, I confess, I was
ashamed to trouble upon such an affair, and should never have
done so had not zeal for the cause induced me), consented to
furnish me with the required paper on the same terms as Mr
P.&nbsp; At present there is not the slightest risk of the
progress of our work being retarded&mdash;at present, indeed, the
path is quite easy; but the trouble, anxiety, and misery which
have till lately harassed me, alone in a situation of great
responsibility, have almost reduced me to a skeleton.</p>
<p>My dearest Sir, do me the favour to ask our excellent
Committee, Would it have answered any useful purpose if, instead
of continuing to struggle with difficulties and using my utmost
to overcome them, I had written in the following strain&mdash;and
what else could I have written if I had written at
all?&mdash;&lsquo;I was sent out to St Petersburg to assist Mr
Lipovzoff in the editing of the Manchu Testament.&nbsp; That
gentleman, who holds three important Situations under the Russian
Government, and who is far advanced in years, has neither time,
inclination, nor eyesight for the task, and I am apprehensive
that my strength and powers unassisted are incompetent to
it&rsquo; (praised be the Lord, they were not!), &lsquo;therefore
I should be glad to return home.&nbsp; Moreover, the compositors
say they are unaccustomed to compose in an unknown tongue from
such scribbled and illegible copy, and they will scarcely assist
me to compose.&nbsp; Moreover, the working printers say (several
went away in disgust) that the paper on which they have to print
is too thin to be wetted, and that to print on dry requires a
twofold exertion of strength, and that they will not do such work
for double wages, for it ruptures them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Would that
have been a welcome communication to the Committee?&nbsp; Would
that have been a communication suited to the public?&nbsp; I was
resolved &lsquo;to do or die,&rsquo; and, instead of distressing
and perplexing the Committee with complaints, to write nothing
until I could write something perfectly satisfactory, as I now
can; <a name="citation132a"></a><a href="#footnote132a"
class="citation">[132a]</a> and to bring about that result I have
spared neither myself nor my own money.&nbsp; I have toiled in a
close printing-office the whole day, during ninety degrees of
heat, for the purpose of setting an example, and have bribed
people to work when nothing but bribes would induce them so to
do.</p>
<p>I am obliged to say all this in self-justification.&nbsp; No
member of the Bible Society would ever have heard a syllable
respecting what I have undergone but for the question,
&lsquo;What has Mr Borrow been about?&rsquo;&nbsp; I hope and
trust that question is now answered to the satisfaction of those
who do Mr Borrow the honour to employ him.&nbsp; In respect to
the expense attending the editing of such a work as the New
Testament in Manchu, I beg leave to observe that I have obtained
the paper, the principal source of expense, at fifteen roubles
per ream less than the Society formerly paid for it&mdash;that is
to say, at nearly half the price.</p>
<p>As St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel has been ready for some weeks, it
is high time that it should be bound; for if that process be
delayed, the paper will be dirtied and the work injured.&nbsp; I
am sorry to inform you that book-binding in Russia is incredibly
dear, <a name="citation132b"></a><a href="#footnote132b"
class="citation">[132b]</a> and that the expenses attending the
binding of the Testament would amount, were the usual course
pursued, to two-thirds of the entire expenses of the work.&nbsp;
Various book-binders to whom I have applied have demanded one
rouble and a half for the binding of every section of the work,
so that the sum required for the binding of one Testament alone
would be twelve roubles.&nbsp; Doctor Schmidt assured me that one
rouble and forty copecks, or, according to the English currency,
fourteenpence halfpenny, were formerly paid for the binding of
every individual copy of St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<p>I pray you, my dear Sir, to cause the books to be referred to,
for I wish to know if that statement be correct.&nbsp; In the
meantime arrangements have to be made, and the Society will have
to pay for each volume of the Testament the comparatively small
sum of forty-five copecks, or fourpence halfpenny, whereas the
usual price here for the most paltry covering of the most paltry
pamphlet is fivepence.&nbsp; Should it be demanded how I have
been able to effect this, my reply is that I have had little hand
in the matter.&nbsp; A nobleman who honours me with particular
friendship, and who is one of the most illustrious ornaments of
Russia and of Europe, has, at my request, prevailed on his own
book-binder, over whom he has much influence, to do the work on
these terms.&nbsp; That nobleman is Baron Schilling.</p>
<p>Commend me to our most respected Committee.&nbsp; Assure them
that in whatever I have done or left undone, I have been
influenced by a desire to promote the glory of the Trinity and to
give my employers ultimate and permanent satisfaction.&nbsp; If I
have erred, it has been from a defect of judgment, and I ask
pardon of God and them.&nbsp; In the course of a week I shall
write again, and give a further account of my proceedings, for I
have not communicated one-tenth of what I have to impart; but I
can write no more now.&nbsp; It is two hours past midnight; the
post goes away to-morrow, and against that morrow I have to
examine and correct three sheets of St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, which
lie beneath the paper on which I am writing.&nbsp; With my best
regards to Mr Brandram,</p>
<p>I remain, dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Most truly yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. <span
class="smcap">Borrow</span>.</p>
<p>Rev. <span class="smcap">Joseph Jowett</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closely following upon this letter, and without waiting for a
reply, Borrow wrote again to Mr Jowett, 13th/25th October,
enclosing a certificate from Mr Lipovzoff, which read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Testifio:&mdash;Dominum Burro ab initio
usque ad hoc tempus summa cum diligentia et studio in re
Mantshurica laborasse, Lipovzoff.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also reported progress as regards the printing, and
promised (D.V.) that the entire undertaking should be completed
by the first of May; but the letter was principally concerned
with the projected expedition to Kiakhta, to distribute the books
he was so busily occupied in printing.&nbsp; He repeated his
former arguments, urging the Committee to send an agent to
Kiakhta.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a person of few words,&rdquo; he
assured Mr Jowett, &ldquo;and will therefore state without
circumlocution that I am willing to become that agent.&nbsp; I
speak Russ, Manchu, and the Tartar or broken Turkish of the
Russian Steppes, and have also some knowledge of Chinese, which I
might easily improve.&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards the danger to
himself of such a hazardous undertaking, the conversion of the
Tartar would never be achieved without danger to someone.&nbsp;
He had become acquainted with many of the Tartars resident in St
Petersburg, whose language he had learned through conversing with
his servant (a native of Bucharia [Bokhara]), and he had become
&ldquo;much attached to them; for their conscientiousness,
honesty, and fidelity are beyond all praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this further offer Mr Jowett replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be not disheartened, even though the
Committee postpone for the present the consideration of your
enterprising, not to say intrepid, proposal.&nbsp; Thus much,
however, I may venture to say: that the offer is more likely to
be accepted now, than when you first made it.&nbsp; If, when the
time approaches for executing such a plan, you give us reason to
believe that a more mature consideration of it in all its
bearings still leaves you in hope of a successful result, and in
heart for making the attempt, my own opinion is that the offer
will ultimately be accepted, and that very cordially.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
NOVEMBER 1834&ndash;SEPTEMBER 1835</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> was an unconventional
editor.&nbsp; He foresaw the interminable delays likely to arise
from allowing workmen to incorporate his corrections in the
type.&nbsp; To obviate these, he first corrected the proof, then,
proceeding to the printing office, he made with his own hands the
necessary alterations in the type.&nbsp; This involved only two
proofs, the second to be submitted to Mr Lipovzoff, instead of
some half a dozen that otherwise would have been necessary.&nbsp;
During these days Borrow was ubiquitous.&nbsp; Even the binder
required his assistance, &ldquo;for everything goes wrong without
a strict surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had passed through <i>the</i> crisis in his
career.&nbsp; Stricken with fever, which was followed by an
attack of the &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo; (only to be driven away by
port wine), he had scarcely found time in which to eat or
sleep.&nbsp; He had emerged triumphantly from the ordeal, and if
he had &ldquo;almost killed Beneze and his lads&rdquo;<a
name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a> with work, he had not spared
himself.&nbsp; If he had to report, as he did, that &ldquo;my two
compositors, whom I had instructed in all the mysteries of Manchu
composition, are in the hospital, down with the brain
fever,&rdquo; <a name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b"
class="citation">[135b]</a> he himself had grown thin from the
incessant toil.</p>
<p>The simple manliness and restrained dignity of his
justification had produced a marked effect upon the authorities
at home.&nbsp; If the rebuke administered by Mr Jowett had been
mild, his acknowledgment of the reply that it had called forth
was most cordial and friendly.&nbsp; After assuring Borrow of the
Committee&rsquo;s high satisfaction at the way in which its
interests had been looked after, he proceeds sincerely to
deprecate anything in his previous letter which may have caused
Borrow pain, and continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet I scarcely know how to be sorry for
what has been the occasion of drawing from you (what you might
otherwise have kept locked up in your own breast) the very
interesting story of your labours, vexations, disappointments,
vigilance, address, perseverance, and successes.&nbsp; How you
were able in your solitude to keep up your spirits in the face of
so many impediments, apparently insurmountable, I know not . . .
Do not fear that <i>we</i> should in any way interrupt your
proceedings.&nbsp; We know our interest too well to interfere
with an agent who has shown so much address in planning, and so
much diligence in effecting, the execution of our
wishes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These encouraging words were followed by a request that he
would keep a careful account of all extraordinary expenses, that
they might be duly met by the Society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I allude, you perceive, to such
things,&rdquo; the letter goes on to explain, &ldquo;as your
journies <i>huc et illuc</i> in quest of a better market, and to
the occasional bribes to disheartened workmen.&nbsp; In all
matters of this kind the Society is clearly your
debtor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow replied with a flash of his old
independent spirit: &ldquo;I return my most grateful thanks for
this most considerate intimation, which, nevertheless, I cannot
avail myself of, as, according to one of the articles of my
agreement, my salary of &pound;200 was to cover all extra
expenses.&nbsp; Petersburg is doubtless the dearest capital in
Europe, and expenses meet an individual, especially one situated
as I have been, at every turn and corner; but an agreement is not
to be broken on that account.&rdquo; <a name="citation136"></a><a
href="#footnote136" class="citation">[136]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the Committee, even before this proof of his ability, had
been well pleased with their engagement of Borrow is shown by the
acknowledgment made in the Society&rsquo;s Thirtieth Annual
Report: &ldquo;Mr Borrow has not disappointed the expectation
entertained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were other words of encouragement to cheer him in his
labours.&nbsp; His mother wrote in September of that year,
telling him how, at a Bible Society&rsquo;s gathering at Norwich,
which had lasted the whole of a week, his name &ldquo;was sounded
through the Hall by Mr Gurney and Mr Cunningham&rdquo;; telling
how he had left his home and his friends to do God&rsquo;s work
in a foreign land, calling upon their fellow-citizens to offer up
prayers beseeching the Almighty to vouchsafe to him health and
strength that the great work he had undertaken might be
completed.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this is very pleasing to me,&rdquo;
added the proud old lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Mrs Clarke of Oulton Hall, with whom he kept up a
correspondence, he heard how his name had been mentioned at many
of the Society&rsquo;s meetings during the year, and how the Rev.
Francis Cunningham had referred to him as &ldquo;one of the most
extraordinary and interesting individuals of the present
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even at that date, viz., before the receipt of
the remarkable account of his labours, the members and officials
of the Bible Society seem to have come to the conclusion that he
had achieved far more than they had any reason to expect of
him.&nbsp; Their subsequent approval is shown by the manner in
which they caused his two letters of 8th/20th and 13th/25th
October to be circulated among the influential members of the
Society, until at last they had reached the Rev. F. Cunningham
and Mrs Clarke.</p>
<p>About the middle of January (old style) 1835, Borrow placed in
the hands of Baron Schilling a copy of each of the four Gospels
in Manchu, to be conveyed to the Bible Society by one of the
couriers attached to the Foreign Department at St Petersburg; but
they did not reach Earl Street until several weeks later.&nbsp;
There were however, still the remaining four volumes to complete,
and many more difficulties to overcome.</p>
<p>One vexation that presented itself was a difference of opinion
between Borrow and Lipovzoff, who &ldquo;thought proper, when the
Father Almighty is addressed, to erase the personal and
possessive pronouns <i>thou</i> or <i>thine</i>, as often as they
occur, and in their stead to make use of the noun as the case may
require.&nbsp; For example, &lsquo;O Father! thou art
merciful&rsquo; he would render, &lsquo;O Father! the Father is
merciful.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow protested, but Lipovzoff,
who was &ldquo;a gentleman, whom the slightest contradiction
never fails to incense to a most incredible degree,&rdquo; told
him that he talked nonsense, and refused to concede anything. <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a>&nbsp; Lipovzoff, who had on his side
the Chinese scholars and unlimited powers as official censor
(from whose decree there was no appeal) over his own work,
carried his point.&nbsp; He urged that &ldquo;amongst the Chinese
and Tartars, none but the dregs of society were ever addressed in
the second person; and that it would be most uncouth and indecent
to speak of the Almighty as if He were a servant or a
slave.&rdquo;&nbsp; This difficulty of the verbal ornament of the
East was one that the Bible Society had frequently met with in
the past.&nbsp; It was rightly considered as ill-fitting a
translation of the words of Christ.&nbsp; Simplicity of diction
was to be preserved at all costs, whatever might be the rule with
secular books.&nbsp; Mr Jowett had warned Borrow to &ldquo;beware
of confounding the two distinct ideas of translation and
interpretation!&rdquo; <a name="citation138b"></a><a
href="#footnote138b" class="citation">[138b]</a> and also
informed him that &ldquo;the passion for honorific-abilitudinity
is a vice of Asiatic languages, which a Scripture translator,
above all others, ought to beware of countenancing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a></p>
<p>Well might Borrow write to Mr Jowett, &ldquo;How I have been
enabled to maintain terms of friendship and familiarity with Mr
Lipovzoff, and yet fulfil the part which those who employ me
expect me to fulfil, I am much at a loss to conjecture; and yet
such is really the case.&rdquo; <a name="citation139b"></a><a
href="#footnote139b" class="citation">[139b]</a>&nbsp; On the
whole, however, the two men worked harmoniously together, the
censor-translator being usually amenable to editorial reason and
suggestion; and Borrow was able to assure Mr Jowett that with the
exception of this one instance &ldquo;the word of God has been
rendered into Manchu as nearly and closely as the idiom of a very
singular language would permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s mind continued to dwell upon the project of
penetrating into China and distributing the Scriptures
himself.&nbsp; He wrote again, repeating &ldquo;the assurance
that I am ready to attempt anything which the Society may wish me
to execute, and, at a moment&rsquo;s warning, will direct my
course towards Canton, Pekin, or the court of the Grand
Lama.&rdquo; <a name="citation139c"></a><a href="#footnote139c"
class="citation">[139c]</a>&nbsp; The project had, however, to be
abandoned.&nbsp; The Russian Government, desirous of maintaining
friendly relations with China, declined to risk her displeasure
for a missionary project in which Russia had neither interest nor
reasonable expectation of gain.&nbsp; In agreeing to issue a
passport such as Borrow desired, it stipulated that he should
carry with him &ldquo;not one single Manchu Bible thither.&rdquo;
<a name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d"
class="citation">[139d]</a>&nbsp; In spite of this
discouragement, Borrow wrote to Mr Jowett with regard to the
Chinese programme, &ldquo;<i>I again repeat that I am at
command</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation139e"></a><a
href="#footnote139e" class="citation">[139e]</a></p>
<p>This determination on Borrow&rsquo;s part to become a
missionary filled his mother with alarm.&nbsp; She had only one
son now, and the very thought of his going into wild and unknown
regions seemed to her tantamount to his going to his death.&nbsp;
Mrs Clarke also expressed strong disapproval of the
project.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; she wrote,
&ldquo;that your letter chilled me when I read your intention of
going as a Missionary or Agent, with the Manchu Scriptures in
your hand, to the Tartars, the land of incalculable
dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the middle of May 1835 Borrow saw the end of his labours in
sight.&nbsp; On 3rd/15th May he wrote asking for instructions
relative to the despatch of the bulk of the volumes, and also as
to the disposal of the type.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;I suppose I must return to England, as my
task will be speedily completed.&nbsp; I hope the Society are
convinced that I have served them faithfully, and that I have
spared no labour to bring out the work, which they did me the
honor of confiding to me, correctly and within as short a time as
possible.&nbsp; At my return, if the Society think that I can
still prove of utility to them, I shall be most happy to devote
myself still to their service.&nbsp; I am a person full of faults
and weaknesses, as I am every day reminded by bitter experience,
but I am certain that my zeal and fidelity towards those who put
confidence in me are not to be shaken.&rdquo; <a
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a></p>
<p>On 15th/27th June he reported the printing completed and six
out of the eight volumes bound, and that as soon as the remaining
two volumes were ready, he intended to take his departure from St
Petersburg; but a new difficulty arose.&nbsp; The East had laid a
heavy hand upon St Petersburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow, please
God!&rdquo; met the energetic Westerner at every turn.&nbsp; The
bookbinder delayed six weeks because he could not procure some
paper he required.&nbsp; But the real obstacle to the despatch of
the books was the non-arrival of the Government sanction to their
shipment.&nbsp; Nothing was permitted to move either in or out of
the sacred city of the Tsars without official permission.&nbsp;
Probably those responsible for the administration of affairs had
never in their experience been called upon to deal with a man
such as Borrow.&nbsp; To apply to him the customary rules of
procedure was to bring upon &ldquo;the House of Interior
Affairs&rdquo; a series of visits and demands that must have left
it limp with astonishment.</p>
<p>On 16th/28th July Borrow wrote to the Bible Society, &ldquo;I
herewith send you a bill of lading for six of the eight parts of
the New Testament, which I have at last obtained permission to
send away, after having paid sixteen visits to the House of
Interior Affairs.&rdquo; <a name="citation141a"></a><a
href="#footnote141a" class="citation">[141a]</a>&nbsp; He
expresses a hope that in another fortnight he will have
despatched the remaining two volumes and have &ldquo;bidden adieu
to Russia&rdquo;; but it was dangerous to anticipate the official
course of events in Russia.&nbsp; Even to the last Borrow was
tormented by red tape.&nbsp; Early in August the last two volumes
were ready for shipment to England; but he could not obtain the
necessary permission.&nbsp; He was told that he ought never to
have printed the work, in spite of the license that had been
granted, and that grave doubts existed in the official mind as to
whether or no he really were an agent of the Bible Society.&nbsp;
At length Borrow lost patience and told the officials that during
the week following the books would be despatched, with or without
permission, and he warned them to have a care how they
acted.&nbsp; These strong measures seem to have produced the
desired result.</p>
<p>Despite his many occupations on behalf of the Bible Society,
Borrow found time in which to translate into Russian the first
three Homilies of the Church of England, and into Manchu the
Second.&nbsp; His desire was that the Homily Society should cause
these translations to be printed, and in a letter to the Rev.
Francis Cunningham he strove to enlist his interest in the
project, offering the translations without fee to the Society if
they chose to make use of them. <a name="citation141b"></a><a
href="#footnote141b" class="citation">[141b]</a>&nbsp; As
&ldquo;a zealous, though most unworthy, member of the Anglican
Church,&rdquo; he found that his &ldquo;cheeks glowed with shame
at seeing dissenters, English and American, busily employed in
circulating Tracts in the Russian tongue, whilst the members of
the Church were following their secular concerns, almost
regardless of things spiritual in respect to the Russian
population.&rdquo; <a name="citation142a"></a><a
href="#footnote142a" class="citation">[142a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow also translated into English &ldquo;one of the sacred
books of Boudh, or Fo,&rdquo; from Baron Schilling de
Canstadt&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; The principal occupation of his
leisure hours, however, was a collection of translations, which
he had printed by Schultz &amp; Beneze, and published (3rd/ 15th
June 1835) under the title of <i>Targum</i>, <i>or Metrical
Translations from Thirty Languages and Dialects</i>. <a
name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a>&nbsp; In a prefatory note, the
collection is referred to as &ldquo;selections from a huge and
undigested mass of translation, accumulated during several years
devoted to philological pursuits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three months later
he published another collection entitled <i>The Talisman</i>,
<i>From the Russian of Alexander Pushkin</i>.&nbsp; <i>With Other
Pieces</i>. <a name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a>&nbsp; There were seven poems in all,
two after Pushkin, one from the Malo-Russian, one from
Mickiewicz, and three &ldquo;ancient Russian Songs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again the printers were Schultz &amp; Beneze.&nbsp; Each of these
editions appears to have been limited to one hundred copies. <a
name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b"
class="citation">[143b]</a></p>
<p>Writing in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, <a
name="citation143c"></a><a href="#footnote143c"
class="citation">[143c]</a> J. P. H[asfeldt]
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The work is a pearl in literature, and, like
pearls, derives value from its scarcity, for the whole edition
was limited to about a hundred copies.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. B. Donne
admired the translations immensely, considering &ldquo;the
language and rhythm as vastly superior to Macaulay&rsquo;s
<i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation143d"></a><a
href="#footnote143d" class="citation">[143d]</a></p>
<p>Whilst the last two volumes of the Manchu New Testament were
waiting for paper (probably for end-papers), Borrow determined to
pay a hurried visit to Moscow, &ldquo;by far the most remarkable
city it has ever been my fortune to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of his
principal objects in visiting the ancient capital of Russia was
to see the gypsies, who flourished there as they flourished
nowhere else in Europe.&nbsp; They numbered several thousands,
and many of them inhabited large and handsome houses, drove in
their carriages, and were &ldquo;distinguishable from the genteel
class of the Russians only . . . by superior personal advantages
and mental accomplishments.&rdquo; <a name="citation143e"></a><a
href="#footnote143e" class="citation">[143e]</a>&nbsp; For this
unusual state of prosperity the women were responsible,
&ldquo;having from time immemorial cultivated their vocal powers
to such an extent that, although in the heart of a country in
which the vocal art has arrived at greater perfection than in any
other part of the world, the principal Gypsy choirs in Moscow are
allowed by the general voice of the public to be unrivalled and
to bear away the palm from all competitors.&nbsp; It is a fact
notorious in Russia that the celebrated Catalani was so filled
with admiration for the powers of voice displayed by one of the
Gypsy songsters, who, after the former had sung before a splendid
audience at Moscow, stepped forward and with an astonishing burst
of melody ravished every ear, that she [Catalani] tore from her
own shoulders a shawl of immense value which had been presented
to her by the Pope, and embracing the Gypsy, compelled her to
accept it, saying that it had been originally intended for the
matchless singer, which she now discovered was not
herself.&rdquo; <a name="citation144a"></a><a
href="#footnote144a" class="citation">[144a]</a></p>
<p>These Russian gypsy singers lived luxurious lives and
frequently married Russian gentry or even the nobility.&nbsp; It
was only the successes, however, who achieved such distinction,
and there were &ldquo;a great number of low, vulgar, and
profligate females who sing in taverns, or at the various gardens
in the neighbourhood, and whose husbands and male connections
subsist by horse-jobbing and such kinds of low traffic.&rdquo; <a
name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b"
class="citation">[144b]</a></p>
<p>One fine evening Borrow hired a calash and drove out to Marina
Rotze, &ldquo;a kind of sylvan garden,&rdquo; about one and a
half miles out of Moscow, where this particular class of Romanys
resorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my arriving there,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;the Gypsies swarmed out of their tents and from the little
<i>tracteer</i> or tavern, and surrounded me.&nbsp; Standing on
the seat of the calash, I addressed them in a loud voice in the
dialect of the English Gypsies, with which I have some slight
acquaintance.&nbsp; A scream of wonder instantly arose, and
welcomes and greetings were poured forth in torrents of musical
Romany, amongst which, however, the most pronounced cry was:
<i>ah kak mi toute karmuma</i> <a name="citation145a"></a><a
href="#footnote145a" class="citation">[145a]</a>&mdash;&lsquo;Oh
how we love you&rsquo;; for at first they supposed me to be one
of their brothers, who, they said, were wandering about in
Turkey, China, and other parts, and that I had come over the
great <i>pawnee</i>, or water, to visit them.&rdquo; <a
name="citation145b"></a><a href="#footnote145b"
class="citation">[145b]</a></p>
<p>On several other occasions during his stay at Moscow, Borrow
went out to Marina Rotze, to hold converse with the
gypsies.&nbsp; He &ldquo;spoke to them upon their sinful manner
of living,&rdquo; about Christianity and the advent of Christ, to
which the gypsies listened with attention, but apparently not
much profit.&nbsp; The promise that they would soon be able to
obtain the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth in their own tongue
interested them far more on account of the pleasurable
strangeness of the idea, than from any anticipation that they
might derive spiritual comfort from such writings.</p>
<p>Returning to St Petersburg from Moscow, after four-days&rsquo;
absence, Borrow completed his work, settled up his affairs, bade
his friends good-bye, and on 28th August/9th September left for
Cronstadt to take the packet for L&uuml;beck.&nbsp; The
authorities seem to have raised no objection to his
departure.&nbsp; His passport bore the date 28th August O/S (the
actual day he left) and described him as &ldquo;of stature,
tall&mdash;hair, grey&mdash;face, oval&mdash;forehead,
medium&mdash;eyebrows, blonde&mdash;eyes, brown&mdash;nose and
mouth, medium&mdash;chin, round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s work at St Petersburg gave entire satisfaction
to the Bible Society.&nbsp; The Official Report for the year 1835
informed the members that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The printing of the Manchu New Testament in
St Petersburg is now drawing to a conclusion.&nbsp; Mr G. Borrow,
who has had to superintend the work, has in every way afforded
satisfaction to the Committee.&nbsp; They have reason to believe
that his acquirements in the language are of the most respectable
order; while the devoted diligence with which he has laboured,
and the skill he has shown in surmounting difficulties, and
conducting his negotiations for the advantage of the Society,
justly entitle him to this public acknowledgment of his
services.&rdquo; <a name="citation146a"></a><a
href="#footnote146a" class="citation">[146a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the actual work itself John Hasfeldt justly wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I can only say, that it is a beautiful
edition of an oriental work&mdash;that it is printed with great
care on a fine imitation of Chinese paper, made on purpose.&nbsp;
At the outset, Mr Borrow spent weeks and months in the printing
office to make the compositors acquainted with the intricate
Manchu types; and that, as for the contents, I am assured by
well-informed persons, that this translation is remarkable for
the correctness and fidelity with which it has been
executed.&rdquo; <a name="citation146b"></a><a
href="#footnote146b" class="citation">[146b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total cost to the Society of his labours in connection
with the transcription of Puerot&rsquo;s MS., and printing and
binding one thousand copies of Lipovzoff&rsquo;s New Testament
had reached the very considerable sum of &pound;2600.&nbsp; What
the amount would have been if Borrow had not proved a prince of
bargainers, it is impossible to imagine.&nbsp; The entire edition
was sent to Earl Street, and eventually distributed in China as
occasion offered.&nbsp; An edition of the Gospels in this version
has recently been reprinted, and is still in use among certain
tribes in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Borrow arrived in London somewhere about 20th September (new
style), after an absence of a little more than two years.&nbsp;
He went to St Petersburg &ldquo;prejudiced against the country,
the government, and the people; the first is much more agreeable
than is generally supposed; the second is seemingly the best
adapted for so vast an empire; and the third, even the lowest
classes, are in general kind, hospitable, and benevolent.&rdquo;
<a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a></p>
<p>On 23rd September Borrow was still in London writing his
report to the General Committee upon his recent labours.&nbsp; In
all probability he left immediately afterwards for Norwich, there
to await events.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
OCTOBER 1835&ndash;JANUARY 1836</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> had strong hopes that the
Bible Society would continue to employ him.&nbsp; Mr Brandram had
written (5th June 1835) that the Committee &ldquo;will not very
willingly suffer themselves to be deprived of your
services.&nbsp; From Russia Borrow had written to his mother: <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They [the Bible Society] place great
confidence in me, and I am firmly resolved to do all in my power
to prove that they have not misplaced that confidence.&nbsp; I
dare say that when I return home they will always be happy to
employ me to edit their Bibles, and there is no employment in the
whole world which I should prefer and for which I am better
fitted.&nbsp; I shall, moreover, endeavour to get
ordained.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On another occasion he wrote, also to his mother:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I hope that the Bible Society will employ
me upon something new, for I have of late led an active life, and
dread the thought of having nothing to do except studying as
formerly, and I am by no means certain that I could sit down to
study now.&nbsp; I can do anything if it is to turn to any
account; but it is very hard to dig holes in the sand and fill
them up again, as I used to do.&nbsp; However, I hope God will
find me something on which I can employ myself with credit and
profit.&nbsp; I should like very much to get into the Church,
though I suppose that that, like all other professions, is
overstocked.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs Borrow reminded him that he had a good home ready to
receive him, and a mother grown lonely with long waiting.&nbsp;
She told him, among other things, that she had spent none of the
money that he had so generously and unsparingly sent her.</p>
<p>Borrow certainly had every reason to expect further
employment.&nbsp; He had proved himself not only a thoroughly
qualified editor; but had discovered business qualities that must
have astonished and delighted the General Committee.&nbsp; Above
all he had brought to a most successful conclusion a venture
that, but for his ability and address, would in all probability
have failed utterly.&nbsp; The application for permission to
proceed with the distribution had, it is true, been unsuccessful;
but there was, as Mr Brandram wrote, the &ldquo;seed laid up in
the granary; but &lsquo;it is not yet written&rsquo; that the
sowers are to go forth to sow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After remaining for a short time with his mother at Norwich,
Borrow appears to have paid a visit to his friends the Skeppers
of Oulton.&nbsp; Old Mrs Skepper, Mrs Clarke&rsquo;s mother, had
just died, and it is a proof of Borrow&rsquo;s intimacy with the
family that he should be invited to stay with them whilst they
were still in mourning.&nbsp; Although there is no record of the
date when he arrived at Oulton, he is known to have been there on
9th October, when he addressed a Bible Society meeting, about
which he wrote the following delectable postscript to a letter he
addressed to Mr Brandram: <a name="citation149"></a><a
href="#footnote149" class="citation">[149]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There has been a Bible meeting at Oulton,
in Suffolk, to which I was invited.&nbsp; The speaking produced
such an effect, that some of the most vicious characters in the
neighbourhood have become weekly subscribers to the Branch
Society.&nbsp; So says the Chronicle of Norfolk in its
report.&rdquo;&nbsp; The actual paragraph read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will doubtless afford satisfaction to the Christian
public to learn that many poor individuals in this neighbourhood,
who previous to attending this meeting were averse to the cause
or indifferent to it, had their feelings so aroused by what was
communicated to them, that they have since voluntarily subscribed
to the Bible Society, actuated by the hope of becoming humbly
instrumental in extending the dominion of the true light, and of
circumscribing the domains of darkness and of Satan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On returning to the quiet of the old Cathedral city, Borrow
had an opportunity of resting and meditating upon the events of
the last two years; but he soon became restless and tired of
inaction. <a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I am weary of doing
nothing, and am sighing for employment,&rdquo; <a
name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b"
class="citation">[150b]</a> he wrote.&nbsp; He had impatiently
awaited some word from Earl Street, where, seemingly, he had
discussed various plans for the future, including a journey to
Portugal and Spain, as well as the printing in Armenian of an
edition of the New Testament.&nbsp; Hearing nothing from Mr
Jowett, he wrote begging to be excused for reminding him that he
was ready to undertake any task that might be allotted to
him.</p>
<p>On the day following, he received a letter from Mr Brandram
telling of how a resolution had been passed that he should go to
Portugal.&nbsp; Then the writer&rsquo;s heart misgave him.&nbsp;
In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw Borrow set down at Oporto.&nbsp;
What would he do?&nbsp; Fearful that the door was not
sufficiently open to justify the step, he had suggested the
suspension of the resolution.&nbsp; Borrow was asked what he
himself thought.&nbsp; What did he think of China, and could he
foresee any prospect for the distribution of the Scriptures
there?&nbsp; &ldquo;Favour us with your thoughts,&rdquo; Mr
Brandram wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;Experimental agency in a Society
like ours is a formidable undertaking.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
replied the same day, <a name="citation150c"></a><a
href="#footnote150c" class="citation">[150c]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As you ask me to favour you with my
thoughts, I certainly will; for I have thought much upon the
matters in question, and the result I will communicate to you in
a very few words.&nbsp; I decidedly approve (and so do all the
religious friends whom I have communicated it to) of the plan of
a journey to Portugal, and am sorry that it has been suspended,
though I am convinced that your own benevolent and excellent
heart was the cause, unwilling to fling me into an undertaking
which you supposed might be attended with peril and
difficulty.&nbsp; Therefore I wish it to be clearly understood
that I am perfectly willing to undertake the expedition, nay, to
extend it into Spain, to visit the town and country, to discourse
with the people, especially those connected with institutions for
infantine education, and to learn what ways and opportunities
present themselves for conveying the Gospel into those benighted
countries.&nbsp; I will moreover undertake, with the blessing of
God, to draw up a small volume of what I shall have seen and
heard there, which cannot fail to be interesting, and if
patronised by the Society will probably help to cover the
expenses of the expedition.&nbsp; On my return I can commence the
Armenian Testament, and whilst I am editing that, I may be
acquiring much vulgar Chinese from some unemployed Lascar or
stray Cantonman whom I may pick up upon the wharves, and then . .
. to China.&nbsp; I have no more to say, for were I to pen twenty
pages, and I have time enough for so doing, I could communicate
nothing which would make my views more clear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earnestness of this letter seems effectually to have
dissipated Mr Brandram&rsquo;s scruples, for events moved forward
with astonishing rapidity.&nbsp; Four days after the receipt of
Borrow&rsquo;s letter, a resolution was adopted by the Committee
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That Mr Borrow be requested to proceed
forthwith to Lisbon and Oporto for the purpose of visiting the
Society&rsquo;s correspondents there, and of making further
enquiries respecting the means and channels which may offer for
promoting the circulation of the Holy Scriptures in
Portugal.&rdquo; <a name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Brandram gave Borrow two letters of introduction, one to
John Wilby, a merchant at Lisbon, and the other to the British
Chaplain, the Rev. E. Whiteley.&nbsp; Having explained to Mr
Whiteley how Borrow had recently been eventually going to be
employed in St Petersburg in editing the Manchu New Testament, he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have some prospect of his eventually going to China; but
having proved by experience that he possesses an order of talent
remarkably suited to the purposes of our Society, we have felt
unwilling to interrupt our connection with him with the
termination of his engagement at St Petersburg.&nbsp; In the
interval we have thought that he might advantageously visit
Portugal, and strengthen your hands and those of other friends,
and see whether he could not extend the promising opening at
present existing.&nbsp; He has no specific instructions, though
he is enjoined to confer very fully with yourself and Mr Wilby of
Lisbon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mentioned his recent occupation at St
Petersburg, and you may perhaps think that there is little
affinity between it and his present visit to Portugal.&nbsp; But
Mr Borrow possesses no little tact in addressing himself to
anything.&nbsp; With Portugal he is already acquainted, and
speaks the language.&nbsp; He proposes visiting several of the
principal cities and towns . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our correspondence about Spain is at this moment
singularly interesting, and if it continues so, and the way seems
to open, Mr Borrow will cross the frontier and go and enquire
what can be done there.&nbsp; We believe him to be one who is
endowed with no small portion of address and a spirit of
enterprise.&nbsp; I recommend him to your kind attentions, and I
anticipate your thanks for so doing, after you shall have become
acquainted with him.&nbsp; Do not, however, be too hasty in
forming your judgment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter outlines very clearly what was in the minds of the
Committee in sending Borrow to Portugal.&nbsp; He was to spy out
the land and advise the home authorities in what direction he
would be most likely to prove useful.&nbsp; He was in particular
to direct his attention to schools, and was &ldquo;authorised to
be liberal in <i>giving</i> New Testaments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Furthermore, he was to be permitted to draw upon the
Society&rsquo;s agents to the extent of one hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The most significant part of this letter is the passage
relating to China.&nbsp; It leaves no doubt that Borrow&rsquo;s
reiterated requests to be employed in distributing the Manchu New
Testament had appealed most strongly to the General
Committee.&nbsp; Mr Brandram was evidently in doubt as to how
Borrow would strike his correspondent as an agent of the Bible
Society, hence his warning against a hasty judgment.&nbsp;
Apparently this letter was never presented, as it was found among
Borrow&rsquo;s papers, and Mr Whiteley had to form his opinion
entirely unaided.</p>
<p>On 6th November Borrow sailed from the Thames for Lisbon in
the steamship <i>London Merchant</i>.&nbsp; The voyage was fair
for the time of year, and was marked only by the tragic
occurrence of a sailor falling from the cross-trees into the sea
and being drowned.&nbsp; The man had dreamed his fate a few
minutes previously, and had told Borrow of the circumstances on
coming up from below. <a name="citation153"></a><a
href="#footnote153" class="citation">[153]</a></p>
<p>Borrow had scarcely been in Lisbon an hour before he heartily
wished himself &ldquo;back in Russia . . . where I had left
cherished friends and warm affections.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Customs-house officers irritated him, first with their
dilatoriness, then by the minuteness with which they examined
every article of which he was possessed.&nbsp; Again, there was
the difficulty of obtaining a suitable lodging, which when
eventually found proved to be &ldquo;dark, dirty and exceedingly
expensive without attendance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Wilby was in the
country and not expected to return for a week.&nbsp; It would
also appear that the British Chaplain was likewise away.&nbsp;
Thus Borrow found himself with no one to advise him as to the
first step he should take.&nbsp; This in itself was no very great
drawback; but he felt very much a stranger in a city that struck
him as detestable.</p>
<p>Determined to commence operations according to the dictates of
his own judgment, he first engaged a Portuguese servant that he
might have ample opportunities of perfecting himself in the
language.&nbsp; He was fortunate in his selection, for Antonio
turned out an excellent fellow, who &ldquo;always served me with
the greatest fidelity, and . . . exhibited an assiduity and a
wish to please which afforded me the utmost satisfaction.&rdquo;
<a name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a"
class="citation">[154a]</a></p>
<p>When Borrow arrived in Portugal, it was to find it gasping and
dazed by eight years of civil war (1826&ndash;1834).&nbsp; In
1807, when Junot invaded the country, the Royal House of Braganza
had sailed for Brazil.&nbsp; In 1816 Dom Jo&#257;o succeeded to
the thrones of Brazil and Portugal, and six years later he
arrived in Portugal, leaving behind him as Viceroy his son Dom
Pedro, who promptly declared himself Emperor of Brazil.&nbsp; Dom
Jo&#257;o died in 1826, leaving, in addition to the self-styled
Emperor of Brazil, another son, Miguel.&nbsp; Dom Pedro
relinquished his claim to the throne of Portugal in favour of his
seven years old daughter, Maria da Gloria, whose right was
contested by her uncle Dom Miguel.&nbsp; In 1834 Dom Miguel
resigned his imaginary rights to the throne by the Convention of
Evora, and departed from the country that for eight years had
been at war with itself, and for seven with a foreign
invader.</p>
<p>Borrow proceeded to acquaint himself with the state of affairs
in Lisbon and the surrounding country, that he might transmit a
full account to the Bible Society.&nbsp; He visited every part of
the city, losing no opportunity of entering into conversation
with anyone with whom he came in contact.&nbsp; The people he
found indifferent to religion, the lower orders in
particular.&nbsp; They laughed in his face when he enquired if
ever they confessed themselves, and a muleteer on being asked if
he reverenced the cross, &ldquo;instantly flew into a rage,
stamped violently, and, spitting on the ground, said it was a
piece of stone, and that he should have no more objection to spit
upon it than the stones on which he trod.&rdquo; <a
name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b"
class="citation">[154b]</a></p>
<p>Many of the people could read, as they proved when asked to do
so from the Portuguese New Testament; but of all those whom he
addressed none appeared to have read the Scriptures, or to know
anything of what they contain.</p>
<p>After spending four or five days at Lisbon, Borrow,
accompanied by Antonio, proceeded to Cintra. <a
name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a>&nbsp; Here he pursued the same
method, also visiting the schools and enquiring into the nature
of the religious instruction.&nbsp; During his stay of four days,
he &ldquo;traversed the country in all directions, riding into
the fields, where I saw the peasants at work, and entering into
discourse with them, and notwithstanding many of my questions
must have appeared to them very singular, I never experienced any
incivility, though they frequently answered me with smiles and
laughter.&rdquo; <a name="citation155b"></a><a
href="#footnote155b" class="citation">[155b]</a></p>
<p>From Cintra he proceeded on horseback to Mafra, a large
village some three leagues distant.&nbsp; Everywhere he subjected
the inhabitants to a searching cross-examination, laying bare
their minds upon religious matters, experiencing surprise at the
&ldquo;free and unembarrassed manner in which the Portuguese
peasantry sustain a conversation, and the purity of the language
in which they express their thoughts,&rdquo; <a
name="citation155c"></a><a href="#footnote155c"
class="citation">[155c]</a> although few could read or write.</p>
<p>On the return journey from Mafra to Cintra he nearly lost his
life, owing to the girth of his saddle breaking during his
horse&rsquo;s exertions in climbing a hill.&nbsp; Borrow was cast
violently to the ground; but fortunately on the right side,
otherwise he would in all probability have been bruised to death
by tumbling down the steep hill-side.&nbsp; As it was, he was
dazed, and felt the effects of his mishap for several days.</p>
<p>On his return to Lisbon, Borrow found that Mr Wilby was back,
and he had many opportunities of taking counsel with him as to
the best means to be adopted to further the Society&rsquo;s
ends.&nbsp; He learned that four hundred copies of the Bible and
the New Testament had arrived, and it was decided to begin
operations at once.&nbsp; Mr Wilby recommended the booksellers as
the best medium of distribution; but Borrow urged strongly that
at least half of the available copies &ldquo;should be entrusted
to colporteurs,&rdquo; who were to receive a commission upon
every copy sold.&nbsp; To this Mr Wilby agreed, provided the
operations of the colporteurs were restricted to Lisbon, as there
was considerable danger in the country, where the priests were
very powerful and might urge the people to mishandle, or even
assassinate, the bearers of the Word.</p>
<p>By nature Borrow was not addicted to half measures.&nbsp; His
whole record as an agent of the Bible Society was of a series of
determined onslaughts upon the obstacles animate and inanimate,
that beset his path.&nbsp; Sometimes he took away the breath of
his adversaries by the very vigour of his attack, and, like the
old Northern leaders, whose deeds he wished to give to an uneager
world in translated verse, he faced great dangers and achieved
great ends.&nbsp; Recognising that the darkest region is most in
need of light, he enquired of Mr Wilby in what province of
Portugal were to be found the most ignorant and benighted people,
and on being told the Alemtejo (the other side of the Tagus), he
immediately announced his intention of making a journey through
it, in order to discover how dense spiritual gloom could really
be in an ostensibly Christian country.</p>
<p>The Alemtejo was an unprepossessing country, consisting for
the most part of &ldquo;heaths, broken by knolls and gloomy
dingles, swamps and forests of stunted pine,&rdquo; with but few
hills and mountains.&nbsp; The place was infested with banditti,
and robberies, accompanied by horrible murders, were of constant
occurrence.&nbsp; On 6th December, accompanied by his servant
Antonio, Borrow set out for Evora, the principal town, formerly a
seat of the dreaded Inquisition, which lies about sixty miles
east of Lisbon.&nbsp; After many adventures, which he himself has
narrated, including a dangerous crossing of the Tagus, and a
meeting with Dom Geronimo Joz&eacute; d&rsquo;Azveto, secretary
to the government of Evora, Borrow arrived at his destination,
having spent two nights on the road.&nbsp; During the journey he
had been constantly mindful of his mission; beside the embers of
a bandit&rsquo;s fire he left a New Testament, and the huts that
mark the spot where Dom Pedro and Dom Miguel met, he sweetened
with some of &ldquo;the precious little tracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had brought with him to Evora twenty Testaments and two
Bibles, half of which he left with an enlightened shopkeeper, to
whom he had a letter of introduction.&nbsp; The other half he
subsequently bestowed upon Dom Geronimo, who proved to be a man
of great earnestness, deeply conscious of his countrymen&rsquo;s
ignorance of true Christianity.&nbsp; Each day during his stay at
Evora, Borrow spent two hours beside the fountain where the
cattle were watered, entering into conversation with all who
approached, the result being that before he left the town, he had
spoken to &ldquo;about two hundred . . . of the children of
Portugal upon matters connected with their eternal
welfare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes his hearers would ask for proofs
of his statements that they were not Christians, being ignorant
of Christ and his teaching, and that the Pope was Satan&rsquo;s
prime minister.&nbsp; He invariably replied by calling attention
to their own ignorance of the Scripture, for if the priests were
in reality Christ&rsquo;s ministers, why had they kept from their
flocks the words of their Master?</p>
<p>When not engaged at the fountain, Borrow rode about the
neighbourhood distributing tracts.&nbsp; Fearful lest the people
might refuse them if offered by his own hand, he dropped them in
their favourite walks, in the hope that they would be picked up
out of curiosity.&nbsp; He caused the daughter of the landlady of
the inn at which he stopped to burn a copy of Volney&rsquo;s
<i>Ruins of Empire</i>, because the author was an &ldquo;emissary
of Satan,&rdquo; the girl standing by telling her beads until the
book were entirely consumed.</p>
<p>Borrow had been greatly handicapped through the lack of
letters of introduction to influential people in Portugal.&nbsp;
He wrote, therefore, to Dr Bowring, now M.P. for Kilmarnock,
telling him of his wanderings among the rustics and banditti of
Portugal, with whom he had become very popular; but, he
continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As it is much more easy to introduce
oneself to the cottage than the hall (though I am not utterly
unknown in the latter), I want you to give or procure me letters
to the most liberal and influential minds in Portugal.&nbsp; I
likewise want a letter from the Foreign Office to Lord [Howard]
de Walden.&nbsp; In a word, I want to make what interest I can
towards obtaining the admission of the Gospel of Jesus into the
public schools of Portugal, which are about to be
established.&nbsp; I beg leave to state that this is <i>my
plan</i> and no other person&rsquo;s, as I was merely sent over
to Portugal to observe the disposition of the people, therefore I
do not wish to be named as an Agent of the B.S., but as a person
who has plans for the mental improvement of the Portuguese;
should I receive <i>these letters</i> within the space of six
weeks it will be time enough, for before setting up my machine in
Portugal, I wish to lay the foundations of something similar in
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;&ldquo;I start for Spain to-morrow, and I want
letters something similar (there is impudence for you) for
Madrid, <i>which I should like to have as soon as
possible</i>.&nbsp; I do not much care at present for an
introduction to the Ambassador at Madrid, as I shall not commence
operations seriously in Spain until I have disposed of
Portugal.&nbsp; I will not apologise for writing to you in this
manner, for you know me, but I will tell you one thing, which is,
that the letter which you procured for me, on my going to St
Petersburg, from Lord Palmerston, assisted me wonderfully; I
called twice at your domicile on my return; the first time you
were in Scotland&mdash;the second in France, and I assure you I
cried with vexation.&nbsp; Remember me to Mrs Bowring, and God
bless you.&rdquo; <a name="citation159a"></a><a
href="#footnote159a" class="citation">[159a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this letter Borrow gives another illustration of his
shrewdness.&nbsp; He saw clearly the disadvantage of appealing
for assistance as an agent of the Bible Society, a Protestant
institution which was anathema in a Roman Catholic country,
whereas if he posed merely as &ldquo;a gentleman who has plans
for the mental improvement of the Portuguese,&rdquo; he could
enlist the sympathetic interest of any and every broad-minded
Portuguese mindful of his country&rsquo;s intellectual
gloom.&nbsp; In response to this request Dr Bowring, writing from
Brussels, sent two letters of introduction, one each for Lisbon
and Madrid.</p>
<p>After remaining at Evora for a week (8th to 17th December)
Borrow returned to Lisbon, thoroughly satisfied with the results
of his journey.&nbsp; The next fortnight he spent in a further
examination of Lisbon, and becoming acquainted with the Jews of
the city, by whom he was welcomed as a powerful rabbi.&nbsp; He
favoured the mistake, with the result that in a few days he
&ldquo;knew all that related to them and their traffic in
Lisbon.&rdquo; <a name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a></p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s methods seem to have impressed Earl Street most
favourably.&nbsp; In a letter of acknowledgment Mr Brandram
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have been much interested by your two
communications. <a name="citation159c"></a><a
href="#footnote159c" class="citation">[159c]</a>&nbsp; They are
both very painful in their details, and you develop a truly awful
state of things.&nbsp; You are probing the wound, and I hope
preparing the way for our pouring in by and by the healing balsam
of the Scripture.&nbsp; We shall be anxious to hear from you
again.&nbsp; We often think of you in your wanderings.&nbsp; We
like your way of communicating with the people, meeting them in
their own walks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoroughly convinced as to the irreligious state of Portugal,
Borrow determined to set out for Spain, in order that he might
examine into the condition of the people, and report to the Bible
Society their state of preparedness to receive the
Scriptures.&nbsp; On the afternoon of 1st January 1836 he set
out, bound for Badajos, a hundred miles south of Lisbon.&nbsp;
From Badajos he intended to take the diligence on to Madrid,
which he decided to make his headquarters.</p>
<p>Having taken leave of his servant Antonio (who had accompanied
him as far as Ald&eacute;a Gall&eacute;ga) almost with tears,
Borrow mounted a hired mule, and with no other companion than an
idiot lad, who, when spoken to, made reply only with an uncouth
laugh, he plunged once more into the dangerous and desolate
Alemtejo on a four days&rsquo; journey &ldquo;over the most
savage and ill-noted track in the whole kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
first he was overwhelmed with a sense of loneliness, and
experienced a great desire for someone with whom to talk.&nbsp;
There was no one to be seen&mdash;he was hemmed in by desolation
and despair.</p>
<p>At Montem&ocirc;r Novo Borrow appears in a new light when he
kisses his hand repeatedly to the tittering nuns who, with
&ldquo;dusky faces and black waving hair,&rdquo; <a
name="citation160a"></a><a href="#footnote160a"
class="citation">[160a]</a> strove to obtain a glance of the
stranger who, a few minutes previously, had dared to tell one of
their number that he had come &ldquo;to endeavour to introduce
the gospel of Christ into a country where it is not known.&rdquo;
<a name="citation160b"></a><a href="#footnote160b"
class="citation">[160b]</a></p>
<p>One adventure befel him that might have ended in
tragedy.&nbsp; Soon after leaving Array&oacute;los he overtook a
string of carts conveying ammunition into Spain.&nbsp; One of the
Portuguese soldiers of the guard began to curse foreigners in
general and Borrow, whom he mistook for a Frenchmen, in
particular, because &ldquo;the devil helps foreigners and hates
the Portuguese.&rdquo;&nbsp; When about forty yards ahead of the
advance guard, with which the discontented soldier marched,
Borrow had the imprudence to laugh, with the result that the next
moment two well-aimed bullets sang past his ears.&nbsp; Taking
the hint, Borrow put spurs to his mule, and, followed by the
terrified guide, soon outdistanced these official banditti.&nbsp;
With great <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> he remarks, &ldquo;Oh, may
I live to see the day when soldiery will no longer be tolerated
in any civilised, or at least Christian country!&rdquo; <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a></p>
<p>For two and a half days the idiot guide had met Borrow&rsquo;s
most dexterous cross-examination with a determined silence; but
on reaching a hill overlooking Estrem&oacute;z he suddenly found
tongue, and, in an epic of inspiration, told of the wonderful
hunting that was to be obtained on the Serre Dorso, the
Alemtejo&rsquo;s finest mountain.&nbsp; &ldquo;He likewise
described with great minuteness a wonderful dog, which was kept
in the neighbourhood for the purpose of catching the wolves and
wild boars, and for which the proprietor had refused twenty
<i>moidores</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation161b"></a><a
href="#footnote161b" class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; From this
it would appear that the idiocy of the guide was an armour to be
assumed at will by one who preferred the sweetness of his own
thoughts to the cross-questionings of his master&rsquo;s
clients.</p>
<p>At Elvas, which he reached on 5th January, Borrow showed very
strongly one rather paradoxical side of his character.&nbsp;
Never backward in his dispraise of Englishmen and things English,
in particular those responsible for the administration of the
nation&rsquo;s affairs, past and present, he demonstrated very
clearly, in his expressions of indignation at the Portuguese
attitude towards England, that he reserved this right of
criticism strictly to himself.&nbsp; At the inn where he stayed,
he thoroughly discomfited a Portuguese officer who dared to
criticise the English Government for its attitude in connection
with the Spanish civil war.&nbsp; When refused entrance to the
fort, where he had gone in order to satisfy his curiosity, Borrow
exclaims, &ldquo;This is one of the beneficial results of
protecting a nation, and squandering blood and treasure in its
defence.&rdquo; <a name="citation162a"></a><a
href="#footnote162a" class="citation">[162a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was essentially an Englishman and proud of his blood,
prouder perhaps of that which came to him from Norfolk, <a
name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b"
class="citation">[162b]</a> and although permitting himself and
his fellow-countrymen considerable license in the matter of
caustic criticism of public men and things, there the matter must
end.&nbsp; Let a foreigner, a Portuguese, dare to say a word
against his, Borrow&rsquo;s, country, and he became subjected to
either a biting cross-examination, or was denounced in eloquent
and telling periods.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not command
myself,&rdquo; he writes in extenuation of his unchristian
conduct in discomfiting the officer at Elvas, &ldquo;when I heard
my own glorious land traduced in this unmerited manner.&nbsp; By
whom?&nbsp; A Portuguese?&nbsp; A native of a country which has
been twice liberated from horrid and detestable thraldom by the
hands of Englishmen.&rdquo; <a name="citation162c"></a><a
href="#footnote162c" class="citation">[162c]</a></p>
<p>On 6th January 1836, <a name="citation162d"></a><a
href="#footnote162d" class="citation">[162d]</a> having sent back
the &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; guide with the two mules, Borrow
&ldquo;spurred down the hill of Elvas to the plain, eager to
arrive in old, chivalrous, romantic Spain,&rdquo; and having
forded the stream that separates the two countries, he crossed
the bridge over the Guadiana and entered the North Gate of
Badajos, immortalised by Wellington and the British Army.&nbsp;
He had reached Spain &ldquo;in the humble hope of being able to
cleanse some of the foul stains of Popery from the minds of its
children.&rdquo; <a name="citation162e"></a><a
href="#footnote162e" class="citation">[162e]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
JANUARY&ndash;OCTOBER 1836</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Borrow entered Spain she was
in the throes of civil war.&nbsp; In 1814 British blood and
British money had restored to the throne Ferdinand VII., who,
immediately he found himself secure, and forgetting his pledges
to govern constitutionally, dissolved the Cortes and became an
absolute monarch.&nbsp; All the old abuses were revived,
including the re-establishment of the Inquisition.&nbsp; For six
years the people suffered their King&rsquo;s tyranny, then they
revolted, with the result that Ferdinand, bending to the wind,
accepted a re-imposition of the Constitution.&nbsp; In 1823 a
French Army occupied Madrid in support of Ferdinand, who promptly
reverted to absolutism.</p>
<p>In 1829 Ferdinand married for the fourth time, and, on the
birth of a daughter, declared that the Salic law had no effect in
Spain, and the young princess was recognised as heir-apparent to
the throne.&nbsp; This drew from his brother, Don Carlos, who
immediately left the country, a protest against his exclusion
from the succession.&nbsp; When his daughter was four years of
age, Ferdinand died, and the child was proclaimed Queen as Isabel
II.</p>
<p>A bitter war broke out between the respective adherents of the
Queen and her uncle Don Carlos.&nbsp; Prisoners and wounded were
massacred without discrimination, and an uncivilised and
barbarous warfare waged when Borrow crossed the Portuguese
frontier &ldquo;to undertake the adventure of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spain had always appealed most strongly to Borrow&rsquo;s
imagination.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the day-dreams of my boyhood,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;Spain always bore a considerable share, and I took
a particular interest in her, without any presentiment that I
should, at a future time, be called upon to take a part, however
humble, in her strange dramas; which interest, at a very early
period, led me to acquire her noble language, and to make myself
acquainted with the literature (scarcely worthy of the language),
her history and traditions; so that when I entered Spain for the
first time I felt more at home than I should otherwise have
done.&rdquo; <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst standing at the door of the Inn of the Three Nations on
the day following his arrival at Badajos, meditating upon the
deplorable state of the country he had just entered, Borrow
recognised in the face of one of two men who were about to pass
him the unmistakable lineaments of Egypt.&nbsp; Uttering &ldquo;a
certain word,&rdquo; he received the reply he expected and
forthwith engaged in conversation with the two men, who both
proved to be gypsies.&nbsp; These men spread the news abroad that
staying at the Inn of the Three Nations was a man who spoke
Romany.&nbsp; &ldquo;In less than half an hour the street before
the inn was filled with the men, women, and children of
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow went out amongst them, and confesses
that &ldquo;so much vileness, dirt, and misery I had never seen
among a similar number of human beings; but worst of all was the
evil expression of their countenances.&rdquo; <a
name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"
class="citation">[164b]</a>&nbsp; He soon discovered that their
faces were an accurate index to their hearts, which were capable
of every species of villainy.&nbsp; The gypsies clustered round
him, fingering his hands, face and clothes, as if he were a holy
man.</p>
<p>Gypsies had always held for Borrow a strange attraction, <a
name="citation164c"></a><a href="#footnote164c"
class="citation">[164c]</a> and he determined to prolong his stay
at Badajos in order that he might have an opportunity of becoming
&ldquo;better acquainted with their condition and manners, and
above all to speak to them of Christ and His Word; for I was
convinced, that should I travel to the end of the universe, I
should meet with no people more in need of a little Christian
exhortation.&rdquo; <a name="citation165a"></a><a
href="#footnote165a" class="citation">[165a]</a></p>
<p>Intimate though his acquaintance with the gypsies of other
countries had been, Borrow was aghast at the depravity of those
of Spain.&nbsp; The men were drunkards, brigands, and murderers;
the women unchaste, and inveterate thieves.&nbsp; Their language
was terrifying in its foulness.&nbsp; They seemed to have no
religion save a misty glimmering of metempsychosis, which had
come down to them through the centuries, and having been very
wicked in this world they asked, with some show of reason, why
they should live again.&nbsp; They were incorrigible heathens,
keenly interested in the demonstration that their language was
capable of being written and read, but untouched by the parables
of Lazarus or the Prodigal Son, which Borrow read and expounded
to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; exclaimed one woman,
&ldquo;you tell us strange things, though perhaps you do not lie;
a month since I would sooner have believed these tales, than that
this day I should see one who could read Romany.&rdquo; <a
name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a></p>
<p>Neither by exhortation nor by translating into Romany a
portion of the Gospel of St Luke could Borrow make any impression
upon the minds of the gypsies, therefore when one of them,
Antonio by name, announced that &ldquo;the affairs of
Egypt&rdquo; called for his presence &ldquo;on the frontiers of
Costumbra,&rdquo; and that he and Borrow might as well journey
thus far together, he decided to avail himself of the
opportunity.&nbsp; It was arranged that Borrow&rsquo;s luggage
should be sent on ahead, for, as Antonio said, &ldquo;How the
<i>Busn&eacute;</i> [the Spaniards] on the road would laugh if
they saw two <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> [Gypsies] with luggage behind
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a>&nbsp; Thus it came about that an
agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, mounted upon a
most uncouth horse &ldquo;of a spectral white, short in the body,
but with remarkably long legs&rdquo; and high in the withers, set
out from Badajos on 16th January 1836, escorted by a smuggler
astride a mule; for the affairs of Egypt on this occasion were
the evasion of the Customs dues.</p>
<p>Towards evening on the first day the curiously assorted pair
arrived at M&eacute;rida, and proceeded to a large and ruinous
house, a portion of which was occupied by some connections of the
gypsy Antonio&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the large hall of the old mansion
they camped, and here, acting on the gypsy&rsquo;s advice, Borrow
remained for three days.&nbsp; Antonio himself was absent from
early morning until late at night, occupied with his own affairs.
<a name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b"
class="citation">[166b]</a></p>
<p>The fourth night was spent in the forest by the campfire of
some more of Antonio&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; On one occasion, but
for the fortunate possession of a passport, the affairs of Egypt
would have involved Borrow in some difficulties with the
authorities.&nbsp; At another time, for safety&rsquo;s sake, he
had to part from Antonio and proceed on his way alone, picking up
the <i>contrabandista</i> further on the road.</p>
<p>When some distance beyond Jaraic&eacute;jo, it was discovered
that the affairs of Egypt had ended disastrously in the
discomfiture and capture of Antonio&rsquo;s friends by the
authorities.&nbsp; The news was brought by the gypsy&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; Antonio must return at once, and as the steed
Borrow was riding, which belonged to Antonio, would be required
by him, Borrow purchased the daughter&rsquo;s donkey, and having
said good-bye to the smuggler, he continued his journey
alone.</p>
<p>By way of Almar&aacute;z and Orop&eacute;sa Borrow eventually
reached Talav&eacute;ra (24th Jan.).&nbsp; On the advice of a
Toledo Jew, with whom he had become acquainted during the last
stage of his journey, he decided to take the diligence from
Talav&eacute;ra to Madrid, the more willingly because the Jew
amiably offered to purchase the donkey.&nbsp; On the evening of
25th Jan. Borrow accordingly took his place on the diligence, and
reached the capital the next morning.</p>
<p>On arriving at Madrid, Borrow first went to a Posada; but a
few days later he removed to lodgings in the Calle de la Zarza
(the Street of the Brambles),&mdash;&ldquo;A dark and dirty
street, which, however, was close to the Puerta del Sol, the most
central point of Madrid, into which four or five of the principal
streets debouche, and which is, at all times of the year, the
great place of assemblage for the idlers of the capital, poor or
rich.&rdquo; <a name="citation167a"></a><a href="#footnote167a"
class="citation">[167a]</a></p>
<p>The capital did not at first impress Borrow very favourably.
<a name="citation167b"></a><a href="#footnote167b"
class="citation">[167b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Madrid is a small
town,&rdquo; he wrote to his mother, <a
name="citation167c"></a><a href="#footnote167c"
class="citation">[167c]</a> &ldquo;not larger than Norwich, but
it is crammed with people, like a hive with bees, and it contains
many fine streets and fountains . . .&nbsp; Everything in Madrid
is excessively dear to foreigners, for they are made to pay six
times more than natives . . .&nbsp; I manage to get on tolerably
well, for I make a point of paying just one quarter of what I am
asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suffered considerably from the frost and cold.&nbsp; From
the snow-covered mountains that surround the city there descend
in winter such cold blasts &ldquo;that the body is drawn up like
a leaf.&rdquo; <a name="citation167d"></a><a href="#footnote167d"
class="citation">[167d]</a>&nbsp; Then again there were the
physical discomforts that he had to endure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot think,&rdquo; he wrote, <a
name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a> &ldquo;what a filthy, uncivilised set
of people the Spanish and Portuguese are.&nbsp; There is more
comfort in an English barn than in one of their palaces; and they
are rude and ill-bred to a surprising degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was angry with Spain, possibly for being so unlike his
&ldquo;dear and glorious Russia.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw in it a
fertile and beautiful country, inhabited by a set of beings that
were not human, &ldquo;almost as bad as the Irish, with the
exception that they are not drunkards.&rdquo; <a
name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"
class="citation">[168b]</a>&nbsp; They were a nation of thieves
and extortioners, who regarded the foreigner as their legitimate
prey.&nbsp; Even his own servant was &ldquo;the greatest thief
and villain that ever existed; who, if I would let him, would
steal the teeth out of my head,&rdquo; <a
name="citation168c"></a><a href="#footnote168c"
class="citation">[168c]</a> and who seems actually to have
destroyed some of his master&rsquo;s letters for the sake of the
postage.&nbsp; Being forced to call upon various people whose
addresses he did not know, Borrow found it necessary to keep the
man, in spite of his thievish proclivities, for he was clever,
and had he been dismissed his place would, in all probability,
have been taken by an even greater rogue.</p>
<p>At night he never went out, for the streets were thronged with
hundreds of people of the rival factions, bent on &ldquo;cutting
and murdering one another; . . . for every Spaniard is by nature
a cruel, cowardly tiger.&nbsp; Nothing is more common than to
destroy a whole town, putting man, woman, and child to death,
because two or three of the inhabitants have been
obnoxious.&rdquo; <a name="citation168d"></a><a
href="#footnote168d" class="citation">[168d]</a>&nbsp; Thus he
wrote to his mother, all-unconscious of the anxiety and alarm
that he was causing her lest he, her dear George, should be one
of the cut or murdered.</p>
<p>Later, Borrow seems to have revised his opinion of Madrid and
of its inhabitants.&nbsp; He confesses that of all the cities he
has known Madrid interested him the most, not on account of its
public buildings, squares or fountains, for these are surpassed
in other cities; but because of its population.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Within a mud wall scarcely one league and a half in
circuit, are contained two hundred thousand human beings,
certainly forming the most extraordinary vital mass to be found
in the entire world.&rdquo; <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a>&nbsp; In the upper
classes he had little interest.&nbsp; He mixed but little with
them, and what he saw did not impress him favourably.&nbsp; It
was the Spaniard of the lower orders that attracted him.&nbsp; He
regarded this class as composed not of common beings, but of
extraordinary men.&nbsp; He admired their spirit of proud
independence, and forgave them their ignorance.&nbsp; His first
impressions of Spain had been unfavourable because, as a
stranger, he had been victimised by the amiable citizens, who
were merely doing as their fathers had done before them.&nbsp;
Once, however, he got to know them, he regarded with more
indulgence their constitutional dishonesty towards the stranger,
a weakness they possessed in common with the gypsies, and hailed
them as &ldquo;extraordinary men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
impulsiveness frequently led him to ill-considered and hasty
conclusions, which, however, he never hesitated to correct, if he
saw need for correction.</p>
<p>The disappointment he experienced as regards Madrid and the
Spaniards is not difficult to understand.&nbsp; He arrived quite
friendless and without letters of introduction, to find the city
given over to the dissensions and strifes of the supporters of
Isabel II. and Don Carlos.&nbsp; His journey had been undertaken
in &ldquo;the hope of obtaining permission from the Government to
print the New Testament in the Castilian language, without the
notes insisted on by the Spanish clergy, for circulation in
Spain,&rdquo; and there seemed small chance of those responsible
for the direction of affairs listening to the application of a
foreigner for permission to print the unannotated
Scriptures.&nbsp; For one thing, any acquiescence in such a
suggestion would draw forth from the priesthood bitter reproaches
and, most probably, active and serious opposition.&nbsp; It is
only natural that despondency should occasionally seize upon him
who sought to light the lamp of truth amidst such tempests.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The man to approach was the premier, Juan &Aacute;lvarez y
Mendiz&aacute;bal, <a name="citation170a"></a><a
href="#footnote170a" class="citation">[170a]</a> a Christianised
Jew.&nbsp; He was enormously powerful, and Borrow decided to
appeal to him direct; for, armed with the approval of
Mendiz&aacute;bal, no one would dare to interfere with his plans
or proceedings.&nbsp; Borrow made several attempts to see
Mendiz&aacute;bal, who &ldquo;was considered as a man of almost
unbounded power, in whose hands were placed the destinies of the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without interest or letters of
introduction, he found it utterly impossible to obtain an
audience.&nbsp; Recollecting the assistance he had received from
the Hon. J. D. Bligh at St Petersburg, Borrow determined to make
himself known to the British Minister at Madrid, the Hon. George
Villiers, <a name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a> and, &ldquo;with the freedom
permitted to a British subject . . . ask his advice in the
affair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was received with great kindness,
and, after conversing upon various topics for some time, he
introduced the subject of his visit.&nbsp; Mr Villiers willingly
undertook to help him as far as lay in his power, and promised to
endeavour to procure for him an audience with the Premier.&nbsp;
In this he was successful, and Borrow had an interview with
Mendiz&aacute;bal, who was almost inaccessible to all but the
few.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock on the morning of 7th February Borrow
presented himself at the palace, where Mendiz&aacute;bal resided,
and after waiting for about three hours, was admitted to the
presence of the Prime Minister of Spain, whom he
found&mdash;&ldquo;A huge athletic man, somewhat taller than
myself, who measure six foot two without my shoes.&nbsp; His
complexion was florid, his features fine and regular, his nose
quite aquiline, and his teeth splendidly white; though scarcely
fifty years of age, his hair was remarkably grey.&nbsp; He was
dressed in a rich morning gown, with a gold chain round his neck,
and morocco slippers on his feet.&rdquo; <a
name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a></p>
<p>Borrow began by assuring Mendiz&aacute;bal that he was
labouring under a grave error in thinking that the Bible Society
had sought to influence unduly the slaves of Cuba, that they had
not sent any agents there, and they were not in communication
with any of the residents.&nbsp; Mr Villiers had warned Borrow
that the premier was very angry on account of reports that had
reached him of the action in Cuba of certain people whom he
insisted were sent there by the Bible Society.&nbsp; In vain
Borrow suggested that the disturbers of the tranquillity of
Spain&rsquo;s beneficent rule in the Island were in no way
connected with Earl Street; he was several times interrupted by
Mendiz&aacute;bal, who insisted that he had documentary
proof.&nbsp; Borrow with difficulty restrained himself from
laughing in the premier s face.&nbsp; He pointed out that the
Committee was composed of quiet, respectable English gentlemen,
who attended to their own concerns and gave a little of their
time to the affairs of the Bible Society.</p>
<p>On Borrow asking for permission to print at Madrid the New
Testament in Spanish without notes, he was met with an
unequivocal refusal.&nbsp; In spite of his arguments that the
whole tenor of the work was against bloodshedding and violence,
he could not shake the premier&rsquo;s opinion that it was
&ldquo;an improper book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Borrow had experienced some difficulty in explaining
himself, on account of the Spaniard&rsquo;s habit of persistent
interruption, and at last he was forced in self-defence to hold
on in spite of Mendiz&aacute;bal&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; The
upshot of the interview was that he was told to renew his
application when the Carlists had been beaten and the country was
at peace.&nbsp; Borrow then asked permission to introduce into
Spain a few copies of the New Testament in the Catalan dialect,
but was refused.&nbsp; He next requested to be allowed to call on
the following day and submit a copy of the Catalan edition, and
received the remarkable reply that the prime-minister refused his
offer to call lest he should succeed in convincing him, and
Mendiz&aacute;bal did not wish to be convinced.&nbsp; This seemed
to show that the Mendiz&aacute;bal was something of a philosopher
and a little of a humorist.</p>
<p>With this Borrow had to be content, and after an hour&rsquo;s
interview he withdrew.&nbsp; The premier was unquestionably in a
difficult position.&nbsp; On the one hand, he no doubt desired to
assist a man introduced to him by the representative of Great
Britain, to whom he looked for assistance in suppressing Carlism;
on the other hand, he had the priesthood to consider, and they
would without question use every means of which they stood
possessed to preserve the prohibition against the dissemination
of the Scriptures, without notes, a prohibition that had become
almost a tradition.</p>
<p>But Borrow was not discouraged.&nbsp; He wrote in a most
hopeful strain that he foresaw the speedy and successful
termination of the Society&rsquo;s negotiations in the
Peninsula.&nbsp; He looked forward to the time when only an agent
would be required to superintend the engagement of colporteurs,
and to make arrangements with the booksellers.&nbsp; He proceeds
to express a hope that his exertions have given satisfaction to
the Society.</p>
<p>Borrow received an encouraging letter from Mr Brandram,
telling him of the Committee&rsquo;s appreciation of his work,
but practically leaving with him the decision as to his future
movements.&nbsp; They were inclined to favour a return to Lisbon,
but recognised that &ldquo;in these wondrous days opportunities
may open unexpectedly.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the matter of the Gospel
of St Luke in Spanish Romany, the publication of extracts was
authorised, but there was no enthusiasm for the project.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We say,&rdquo; wrote Mr Brandram, &ldquo;<i>festina
lente</i>.&nbsp; You will be doing well to occupy leisure hours
with this work; but we are not prepared for printing anything
beyond portions at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, an article in the Madrid newspaper,
<i>El Espa&ntilde;ol</i>, upon the history, aims, and
achievements of the British and Foreign Bible Society, had
determined Borrow to remain on at Madrid for a few weeks at
least.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why should Spain, which has explored the
New World, why should she alone be destitute of Bible
Societies,&rdquo; asked the <i>Espa&ntilde;ol</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should a nation eminently Catholic continue isolated
from the rest of Europe, without joining in the magnificent
enterprise in which the latter is so busily engaged?&rdquo; <a
name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article fired Borrow, and with the promise of assistance
from the liberal-minded <i>Espa&ntilde;ol</i>, he set to work
&ldquo;to lay the foundation of a Bible Society at Madrid.&rdquo;
<a name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a>&nbsp; As a potential head of the
Spanish organization, Borrow&rsquo;s eyes were already directed
towards the person of &ldquo;a certain Bishop, advanced in years,
a person of great piety and learning, who has himself translated
the New Testament&rdquo; <a name="citation173c"></a><a
href="#footnote173c" class="citation">[173c]</a> and who was
disposed to print and circulate it.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, came of the project.&nbsp; Mr Brandram wrote
to Borrow:&mdash;&ldquo;With regard to forming a Bible Society in
Madrid, and appointing Dr Usoz Secretary, it is so out of our
usual course that the Committee, for various reasons, cannot
comply with your wishes&mdash;of the desirableness of forming
such a Society at present, you and your friend must be the best
judges.&nbsp; If it is to be an independent society, as I suppose
must be the case,&rdquo; Mr Brandram continues, and the Bible
Society&rsquo;s aid or that of its agent is sought, the new
Society must be formed on the principles of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, admitting, &ldquo;on the one hand, general
cooperation, and on the other, that it does not circulate
Apocryphal Bibles.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was doubt at Earl Street as
to whether the time was yet ripe; so the decision was very
properly left with Borrow, and he was told that he &ldquo;need
not fear to hold out great hopes of encouragement in the event of
the formation of such a Society.&rdquo; <a
name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174"
class="citation">[174]</a></p>
<p>A serious difficulty now arose in the resignation of
Mendiz&aacute;bal (March 1836).&nbsp; Two of his friends and
supporters, in the persons of Francisco de Isturitz and Alcala
Galiano, seceded from his party, and, under the name of
<i>moderados</i>, formed an opposition to their Chief in the
Cortes.&nbsp; They had the support of the Queen Regent and
General Cordova, whom Mendiz&aacute;bal had wished to remove from
his position as head of the army on account of his great
popularity with the soldiers, whose comforts and interests he
studied.&nbsp; Isturitz became Premier, Galiano Minister of
Marine (a mere paper title, as there was no navy at the time),
and the Duke of Rivas Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p>Conscious of the advantage of possessing powerful friends,
especially in a country such as Spain, Borrow had used every
endeavour to enlarge the circle of his acquaintance among men
occupying influential positions, or likely to succeed those who
at present filled them.&nbsp; The result was that he was able to
announce to Mr Brandram that the new ministry, which had been
formed, was composed &ldquo;entirely of <i>my</i> friends.&rdquo;
<a name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a>&nbsp; With Galiano in particular he
was on very intimate terms.&nbsp; Everything promised well, and
the new Cabinet showed itself most friendly to Borrow and his
projects, until the actual moment arrived for writing the
permission to print the Scriptures in Spanish.&nbsp; Then doubts
arose, and the decrees of the Council of Trent loomed up, a
threatening barrier, in the eyes of the Duke of Rivas and his
secretary.</p>
<p>So hopeful was Borrow after his first interview with the Duke
that he wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;I shall receive the permission, the
Lord willing, in a few days . . . The last skirts of the cloud of
papal superstition are vanishing below the horizon of Spain;
whoever says the contrary either knows nothing of the matter or
wilfully hides the truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation175b"></a><a
href="#footnote175b" class="citation">[175b]</a></p>
<p>At Earl Street the good news about the article in the
<i>Espa&ntilde;ol</i> gave the liveliest satisfaction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely a new and wonderful thing in Spain,&rdquo; wrote Mr
Brandram <a name="citation175c"></a><a href="#footnote175c"
class="citation">[175c]</a> in a letter in which he urged Borrow
to &ldquo;guard against becoming too much committed to one
political party,&rdquo; and asked him to write more frequently,
as his letters were always most welcome.&nbsp; This letter
reached Madrid at a time when Borrow found himself absolutely
destitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last three weeks,&rdquo; he writes, <a
name="citation175d"></a><a href="#footnote175d"
class="citation">[175d]</a> &ldquo;I have been without money,
literally without a farthing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everything in Madrid
was so dear.&nbsp; A month previously he had been forced to pay
&pound;12, 5s. for a suit of clothes, &ldquo;my own being so worn
that it was impossible to appear longer in public with
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation175e"></a><a href="#footnote175e"
class="citation">[175e]</a>&nbsp; He had written to Mr Wilby, but
in all probability his letter had gone astray, the post to
Estremadura having been three times robbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
money may still come,&rdquo; he continues, <a
name="citation176a"></a><a href="#footnote176a"
class="citation">[176a]</a> &ldquo;but I have given up all hopes
of it, and I am compelled to write home, though what I am to do
till I can receive your answer I am at a loss to conceive . . .
whatever I undergo, I shall tell nobody of my situation, it might
hurt the Society and our projects here.&nbsp; I know enough of
the world to be aware that it is considered as the worst of
crimes to be without money.&rdquo; <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a></p>
<p>For weeks Borrow devoted himself to the task of endeavouring
to obtain permission to print the Scriptures in Spanish.&nbsp;
The Duke of Rivas referred him to his secretary, saying,
&ldquo;He will do for you what you want!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
secretary retreated behind the decrees of the Council of
Trent.&nbsp; Then Mr Villiers intervened, saw the Duke and gave
Borrow a letter to him.&nbsp; Again the Council of Trent proved
to be the obstacle.&nbsp; Galiano took up the matter and escorted
Borrow to the Bureau of the Interior, and had an interview with
the Duke&rsquo;s secretary.&nbsp; When Galiano left, there
remained nothing for the conscientious secretary to do but to
write out the formal permission, all else having been
satisfactorily settled; but no sooner had Galiano departed, than
the recollection of the Council of Trent returned to the
secretary with terrifying distinctness, and no permission was
given.</p>
<p>Tired of the Council of Trent and the Duke&rsquo;s secretary,
Borrow would sometimes retire to the banks of the canal and there
loiter in the sun, watching the gold and silver fish basking on
the surface of its waters, or gossiping with the man who sold
oranges and water under the shade of the old water-tower.&nbsp;
Once he went to see an execution&mdash;anything to drive from his
mind the conscientious secretary and the Council of Trent, the
sole obstacles to the realisation of his plans.</p>
<p>Borrow informed Mr Brandram at the end of May that the Cabinet
was unanimously in favour of granting his request; nothing
happened.&nbsp; There seems no doubt that the Cabinet&rsquo;s
policy was one of subterfuge.&nbsp; It could not afford to offend
the British Minister, nor could it, at that juncture, risk the
bitter hostility of the clergy, consequently it promised and
deferred.&nbsp; A petition to the Ecclesiastical Committee of
Censors, although strongly backed by the Civil Governor of Madrid
(within whose department lay the censorship), produced no better
result.&nbsp; There was nothing heard but &ldquo;To-morrow,
please God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foiled for the time being in his constructive policy, Borrow
turned his attention to one of destruction.&nbsp; He had already
announced to the Bible Society that the authority of the Pope was
in a precarious condition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Little more than a breath is required to
destroy it,&rdquo; he writes, <a name="citation177"></a><a
href="#footnote177" class="citation">[177]</a> &ldquo;and I am
almost confident that in less than a year it will be
disowned.&nbsp; I am doing whatever I can in Madrid to prepare
the way for an event so desirable.&nbsp; I mix with the people,
and inform them who and what the Pope is, and how disastrous to
Spain his influence has been.&nbsp; I tell them that the
indulgences, which they are in the habit of purchasing, are of no
more intrinsic value than so many pieces of paper, and were
merely invented with the view of plundering them.&nbsp; I
frequently ask: &lsquo;Is it possible that God, who is good,
would sanction the sale of sin? and, supposing certain things are
sinful, do you think that God, for the sake of your money, would
permit you to perform them?&rsquo;&nbsp; In many instances my
hearers have been satisfied with this simple reasoning, and have
said that they would buy no more indulgences.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Brandram promptly wrote warning Borrow against becoming
involved in any endeavour to hasten the fall of the Pope.&nbsp;
Although deeply interested in what their agent had to say, there
was a strong misgiving at headquarters that for a few moments
Borrow had &ldquo;forgotten that our hopes of the fall of &mdash;
are founded on the simple distribution of the Scriptures,&rdquo;
<a name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a"
class="citation">[178a]</a> and he was told that, as their agent,
he must not pursue the course that he described.&nbsp; The
warning was carefully worded, so that it might not wound
Borrow&rsquo;s feelings or lessen his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Borrow had found that the climate of Madrid did not agree with
him.&nbsp; It had proved very trying during the winter; but now
that summer had arrived the heat was suffocating and the air
seemed to be filled with &ldquo;flaming vapours,&rdquo; and even
the Spaniards would &ldquo;lie gasping and naked upon their brick
floors.&rdquo; <a name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b"
class="citation">[178b]</a>&nbsp; In spite of the heat, however,
he was occupied &ldquo;upon an average ten hours every day,
dancing attendance on one or another of the Ministers.&rdquo; <a
name="citation178c"></a><a href="#footnote178c"
class="citation">[178c]</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the difficulties that he had to contend with reduced
him almost to despair of ever obtaining the permission he
sought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only those,&rdquo; he writes, <a
name="citation178d"></a><a href="#footnote178d"
class="citation">[178d]</a> &ldquo;who have been in the habit of
dealing with Spaniards, by whom the most solemn promises are
habitually broken, can form a correct idea of my reiterated
disappointments, and of the toil of body and agony of spirit
which I have been subjected to.&nbsp; One day I have been told,
at the Ministry, that I had only to wait a few moments and all I
wished would be acceded to; and then my hopes have been blasted
with the information that various difficulties, which seemed
insurmountable, had presented themselves, whereupon I have
departed almost broken-hearted; but the next day I have been
summoned in a great hurry and informed that &lsquo;all was
right,&rsquo; and that on the morrow a regular authority to print
the Scriptures would be delivered to me, but by that time fresh
and yet more terrible difficulties had occurred&mdash;so that I
became weary of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Villiers evidently saw through the Spanish Cabinet&rsquo;s
policy of delay; for he spoke to the ministers collectively and
individually, strongly recommending that the petition be
granted.&nbsp; He further pointed out the terrible condition of
the people, who lacked religious instruction of any kind, and
that a nation of atheists would not prove very easy to
govern.&nbsp; It may have been these arguments, or, what is more
likely, a desire on the part of the Cabinet to please the
representative of Great Britain, in any case a greater
willingness was now shown to give the necessary permission.&nbsp;
Measures were accordingly taken to evade the law and protect the
printer into whose hands the work was to be entrusted, until an
appropriate moment arrived for repealing the existing
statute.</p>
<p>Borrow forwarded to Earl Street the following interesting
letter that he had received from Mr Villiers, which confirms his
words as to the keen interest taken by the British Minister in
the endeavour to obtain the permission to print the New Testament
in Spanish</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have had a long conversation with Mr Isturitz upon the
subject of printing the Testament, in which he showed himself to
be both sagacious and liberal.&nbsp; He assured me that the
matter should have his support whenever the Duque de Ribas
brought it before the Cabinet, and that as far as he was
concerned the question <i>might be considered as settled</i>.</p>
<p>You are quite welcome to make any use you please of this note
with the D. de Ribas or Mr Olivan. <a name="citation179a"></a><a
href="#footnote179a" class="citation">[179a]</a></p>
<p>I am, Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Villiers</span>.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 23<i>rd</i> [1836].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was unquestionably Borrow&rsquo;s personality that was
responsible for Mr Villiers&rsquo; interest in the scheme, as
when Lieutenant Graydon <a name="citation179b"></a><a
href="#footnote179b" class="citation">[179b]</a> had applied to
him on a previous occasion he declined to interfere.</p>
<p>At Borrow&rsquo;s suggestion the President of the Bible
Society, Lord Bentley, wrote to Mr Villiers thanking him for the
services he had rendered in connection with the Spanish
programme.&nbsp; It was characteristic of Borrow that he added to
his letter as a reason for his request, that &ldquo;I may be
again in need of Mr V&rsquo;s. assistance before I leave
Spain.&rdquo; <a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a>&nbsp; Borrow was always keenly alive
to the advantage of possessing influential friends who would be
likely to assist him in his labours for the Society.&nbsp; He was
not a profound admirer of the Society of Jesus for nothing, and
although he would scorn to exercise tact in regard to his own
concerns, he was fully prepared to make use of it in connection
with those of the Bible Society.&nbsp; He was a Jesuit at heart,
and would in all probability have preferred a good compositor who
had been guilty of sacrilege to a bad one who had not.&nbsp; He
saw that besides being something of a diplomatist, an agent of
the Bible Society had also to be a good business man.&nbsp; He
has been called tactless, until the word seems to have become
permanently identified with his name; how unjustly is shown by a
very hasty examination of his masterly diplomacy, both in Russia
and Spain.&nbsp; Diplomacy, as Borrow understood it, was the art
of being persuasive when persuasion would obtain for him his
object, and firm, even threatening, when strong measures were
best calculated to suit his ends.&nbsp; It is only the fool who
defines tact as the gentle art of pleasing everybody.&nbsp;
Diplomacy is the art of getting what you want at the expense of
displeasing as few people as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair is settled&mdash;thank God!!! and we may
begin to print whenever we think proper.&rdquo;&nbsp; With these
words Borrow announces the success of his enterprise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps you have thought,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;that
I have been tardy in accomplishing the business which brought me
to Spain; but to be able to form a correct judgment you ought to
be aware of all the difficulties which I have had to encounter,
and which I shall not enumerate.&nbsp; I shall content myself
with observing that for a thousand pounds I would not undergo
again all the mortifications and disappointments of the last two
months.&rdquo; <a name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a"
class="citation">[181a]</a></p>
<p>There were moments when Borrow forgot the idiom of Earl Street
and reverted to his old, self-confident style, which had so
alarmed some of the excellent members of the Committee.&nbsp; He
had achieved a great triumph, how great is best shown by the
suggestion made by the prime minister that if determined to avail
himself of the permission that had been obtained, he had better
employ &ldquo;the confidential printer of the Government, who
would keep the matter secret; as in the present state of affairs
he [the prime minister] would not answer for the consequences if
it were noised abroad.&rdquo; <a name="citation181b"></a><a
href="#footnote181b" class="citation">[181b]</a>&nbsp; By giving
the license to print the New Testament without notes, the Cabinet
was assuming a very grave responsibility.&nbsp; All this shows
how great was the influence of the British Minister upon the
Isturitz Cabinet, and how considerable that of Borrow upon the
British Minister.</p>
<p>Now that his object was gained, there was nothing further to
keep Borrow in Spain, and he accordingly asked for instructions,
suggesting that, as soon as the heats were over, Lieutenant
Graydon might return to Madrid and take charge, &ldquo;as nothing
very difficult remains to be accomplished, and I am sure that Mr
Villiers, at my entreaty, would extend to him the patronage with
which he has honoured me.&rdquo; <a name="citation181c"></a><a
href="#footnote181c" class="citation">[181c]</a>&nbsp; In
conclusion he announced himself as ready to do &ldquo;whatever
the Bible Society may deem expedient.&rdquo; <a
name="citation181d"></a><a href="#footnote181d"
class="citation">[181d]</a></p>
<p>Borrow now began to suffer from the reaction after his great
exertions.&nbsp; He became so languid as scarcely to be able to
hold a pen.&nbsp; He had no books, and conversation was
impossible, for the heat had driven away all who could possibly
escape, among them his acquaintances, and he frequently
remembered with a sigh the happy days spent in St Petersburg.</p>
<p>A few days later (25th July) he wrote proposing as a member of
the Bible Society Dr Luis de Usoz y Rio, &ldquo;a person of great
respectability and great learning.&rdquo; <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a>&nbsp; Dr Usoz, who was subsequently
to be closely associated with Borrow in his labours in Spain, was
a man of whom he was unable to &ldquo;speak in too high terms of
admiration; he is one of the most learned men in Spain, and is
become in every point a Christian according to the standard of
the New Testament.&rdquo; <a name="citation182b"></a><a
href="#footnote182b" class="citation">[182b]</a></p>
<p>Dr Usoz also addressed a letter to the Society asking to be
considered as a correspondent and entrusted with copies of the
Scriptures, which he was convinced he could circulate in every
province of Spain.&nbsp; The advantage of having one of the
editors of the principal newspaper of Spain on the side of the
Society did not fail to appeal to Borrow.&nbsp; Dr Usoz not only
became a member of the Bible Society, but earned from Borrow a
splendid tribute in the Preface to <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
<p>Before advantage could be taken of the hardly earned
permission to print the New Testament in Madrid, the Revolution
of La Granja <a name="citation182c"></a><a href="#footnote182c"
class="citation">[182c]</a> broke out, resulting in the
proclamation of the Constitution of 1812, by which the press
became free.&nbsp; In Madrid chaos reigned as a result.&nbsp;
Borrow himself has given a vivid account of how Quesada, by his
magnificent courage, quelled for the time being the revolution,
how the ministers fled, how eventually the heroic tyrant was
recognised and killed, and, finally, how, at a celebrated
coffee-house in Madrid, Borrow saw the victorious Nationals drink
to the Constitution from a bowl of coffee, which had first been
stirred with one of the mutilated hands of the hated Quesada. <a
name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a"
class="citation">[183a]</a></p>
<p>Now that no obstacle stood in the way of the printing of the
Spanish New Testament, Borrow was requested to return to England
that he might confer with the authorities at Earl Street.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may now consider yourself under marching orders to
return home as soon as you have made all the requisite
arrangements; . . . you have done, we are persuaded, a good and
great work,&rdquo; <a name="citation183b"></a><a
href="#footnote183b" class="citation">[183b]</a> Mr Brandram
wrote.&nbsp; It was thought by the Committee that the advantages
to be derived from a conference with Borrow would be well worth
the expense involved in his having to return again to Spain.</p>
<p>To this request for his immediate presence in London Borrow
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I shall make the provisional engagement as
desired [as regards the printing of the New Testament] and shall
leave Madrid as soon as possible; but I must here inform you,
that I shall find much difficulty in returning to England, as all
the provinces are disturbed in consequence of the Constitution of
1812 having been proclaimed, and the roads are swarming with
robbers and banditti.&nbsp; It is my intention to join some
muleteers, and attempt to reach Granada, from whence, if
possible, I shall proceed to Malaga or Gibraltar, and thence to
Lisbon, where I left the greatest part of my baggage.&nbsp; Do
not be surprised, therefore, if I am tardy in making my
appearance; it is no easy thing at present to travel in
Spain.&nbsp; But all these troubles are for the benefit of the
Cause, and must not be repined at.&rdquo; <a
name="citation183c"></a><a href="#footnote183c"
class="citation">[183c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving Madrid on 20th August, Borrow was at Granada on the
30th, as proved by the Visitors&rsquo; Book, in which he signed
himself</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;George Borrow Norvicensis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real object of this visit appears to have been his desire
to study more closely the Spanish gypsies.&nbsp; From Granada he
proceeded to Malaga.&nbsp; Neither place can be said to be on the
direct road to England; but the disturbed state of the country
had to be taken into consideration, and it was a question not of
the shortest road but the safest.</p>
<p>On his return to London, early in October, Borrow wrote a
report <a name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> upon his labours, roughly sketching
out his work since he left Badajos.&nbsp; He repeated his view
that the Papal See had lost its power over Spain, and that the
present moment was a peculiarly appropriate one in which to
spread the light of the Gospel over the Peninsula.&nbsp;
Forgetting the thievish propensities of the race, he wrote
glowingly of the Spaniards and their intellectual equipment, the
clearness with which they expressed themselves, and the elegance
of their diction.&nbsp; The mind of the Spaniard was a garden run
to waste, and it was for the British and Foreign Bible Society to
cultivate it and purge it of the rank and bitter weeds.</p>
<p>He foresaw no difficulty whatever in disposing of 5000 copies
of the New Testament in a short time in the capital and
provincial towns, in particular Cadiz and Seville where the
people were more enlightened.&nbsp; He was not so confident about
the rural districts, where those who assured him that they were
acquainted with the New Testament said that it contained hymns
addressed to the Virgin which were written by the Pope.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
NOVEMBER 1836&ndash;MAY 1837</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> remained in England for a
month (3rd October/4th November), during which time he conferred
with the Committee and Officials at Earl Street as to the future
programme in Spain.&nbsp; On 4th November, having sent to his
mother &pound;130 of the &pound;150 he had drawn as salary, and
promising to write to Mr Brandram from Cadiz, he sailed from
London in the steamer <i>Manchester</i>, bound for Lisbon and
Cadiz.</p>
<p>In a letter to his mother, he describes his fellow passengers
as invalids fleeing from the English winter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of
them are three parts gone with consumption,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;some are ruptured, some have broken backs; I am the only
sound person in the ship, which is crowded to suffocation.&nbsp;
I am in a little hole of a berth where I can scarcely breathe,
and every now and then wet through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horrors of the voyage from Falmouth to Lisbon he has
described with terrifying vividness; <a
name="citation185a"></a><a href="#footnote185a"
class="citation">[185a]</a> how the engines broke down and the
vessel was being driven on to Cape Finisterre; how all hope had
been abandoned, and the Captain had told the passengers of their
impending fate; how the wind suddenly &ldquo;<i>veered right
about</i>, and pushed us from the horrible coast faster than it
had previously driven us towards it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation185b"></a><a href="#footnote185b"
class="citation">[185b]</a></p>
<p>During the whole of that terrible night Borrow had remained on
deck, all the other passengers having been battened down
below.&nbsp; He was almost drowned in the seas that broke over
the vessel, and, on one occasion, was struck down by a water cask
that had broken away from its lashings.&nbsp; Even after he had
escaped Cape Finisterre, the ordeal was not over; for the ship
was in a sinking condition, and fire broke out on board.&nbsp;
Eventually the engines were repaired, the fire extinguished, and
Lisbon was reached on the 13th, where Borrow landed with his
water-soaked luggage, and found on examination that the greater
part of his clothes had been ruined.&nbsp; In spite of this
experience, he determined to continue his voyage to Cadiz in the
<i>Manchester</i>, probably for reasons of economy, indifferent
to the fact that she was utterly unseaworthy, and that most of
the other passengers had abandoned her.&nbsp; During his enforced
stay in Lisbon, whilst the ship was being patched up, Borrow saw
Mr Wilby and made enquiry into the state of the Society&rsquo;s
affairs in Portugal.&nbsp; Many changes had taken place and the
country was in a distracted state.</p>
<p>After a week&rsquo;s delay at Lisbon the <i>Manchester</i>
continued her voyage to Cadiz, where she arrived without further
mishap on the 21st.&nbsp; During this voyage a fellow passenger
with Borrow was the Marqu&eacute;s de Santa Coloma.&nbsp;
&ldquo;According to the expression of the Marqu&eacute;s, when
they stepped on to the quay at Cadiz, Borrow looked round, saw
some Gitanos lounging there, said something that the
Marqu&eacute;s could not understand, and immediately &lsquo;that
man became <i>une grappe de Gitanos</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; They hung
round his neck, clung to his knees, seized his hands, kissed his
feet, so that the Marqu&eacute;s hardly liked to join his comrade
again after such close embraces by so dirty a company.&rdquo; <a
name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a></p>
<p>Borrow now found himself in his allotted field&mdash;unhappy,
miserable, distracted Spain.&nbsp; Gomez, the Carlist leader, had
been sweeping through Estremadura like a pestilence, and Borrow
fully expected to find Seville occupied by his banditti; but
Carlists possessed no terrors for him.&nbsp; Unless he could do
something to heal the spiritual wounds of the wretched country,
he assured Mr Brandram, he would never again return to
England.</p>
<p>On 1st December Mr Brandram wrote to Borrow expressing deep
sympathy with all he had been through, and adding: &ldquo;If you
go forward . . . we will help you by prayer.&nbsp; If you retreat
we shall welcome you cordially.&rdquo;&nbsp; He appears to have
written before consulting with the Committee, who, on hearing of
the actual state of affairs in Spain, became filled with
misgiving and anxiety for the safety of their agent, who seemed
to be destitute of fear.&nbsp; Mr Brandram had been content for
Borrow to go forward if he so decided, but, as he wrote later,
&ldquo;your prospective dangers, while they created an absorbing
interest, were viewed in different lights by the
Committee,&rdquo; who thought they had &ldquo;no right to commit
you to such perils.&nbsp; My own feeling was that, while I could
not urge you forward, there were peculiarities in your history
and character that I would not keep you back if you were minded
to go.&nbsp; A few felt with me&mdash;most, however, thought that
you should have been restrained.&rdquo; <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; It was decided therefore to
forbid him to proceed on his hazardous adventure, and accordingly
a letter was addressed to him care of the British Consul at
Cadiz.&nbsp; If Borrow received this he disregarded the
instructions it contained.</p>
<p>Cadiz proved to be in a state of great confusion.&nbsp; It was
reported that numerous bands of Carlists were in the
neighbourhood, and the whole city was in a state of ferment in
consequence.&nbsp; In the coffee-houses the din of tongues was
deafening; would-be orators, sometimes as many as six at one
time, sprang up upon chairs and tables and ventilated their
political views.&nbsp; The paramount, nay, the only, interest was
not in the words of Christ; but the probable doings of the
Carlists.</p>
<p>On the night of his arrival Borrow was taken ill with what, at
the time, he thought to be cholera, and for some time in the
little &ldquo;cock-loft or garret&rdquo; that had been allotted
to him at the over-crowded French hotel, he was &ldquo;in most
acute pain, and terribly sick,&rdquo; drinking oil mixed with
brandy.&nbsp; For two days he was so exhausted as to be able to
do nothing.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th he embarked in a small Spanish
steamer bound for Seville, which was reached that same
night.&nbsp; The sun had dissipated the melancholy and stupor
left by his illness, and by the time he arrived at Seville he was
repeating Latin verses and fragments of old Spanish ballads to a
brilliant moon.&nbsp; The condition of affairs at Seville was as
bad if not worse than at Cadiz.&nbsp; There was scarcely any
communication with the capital, the diligences no longer ran, and
even the fearless <i>arrieros</i> (muleteers) declined to set
out.&nbsp; Famine, plunder and murder were let loose over the
land.&nbsp; Bands of banditti robbed, tortured and slew in the
name of Don Carlos.&nbsp; They stripped the peasantry of all they
possessed, and the poor wretches in turn became brigands and
preyed upon those weaker than themselves.&nbsp; Through all this
Borrow had to penetrate in order to reach Madrid.&nbsp; Had the
road been familiar to him he would have performed the journey
alone, dressed either as a beggar or as a gypsy.&nbsp; It is
obvious that he appreciated the hazardous nature of the journey
he was undertaking, for he asked Mr Brandram, in the event of his
death, to keep the news from old Mrs Borrow as long as possible
and then to go down to Norwich and break it to her himself.</p>
<p>At Seville Borrow encountered Baron Taylor, <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a> whom he states that he had first met
at Bayonne (during the &ldquo;veiled period&rdquo;), and later in
Russia, beside the Bosphorus, and finally in the South of
Ireland.&nbsp; Than Baron Taylor there was no one for whom Borrow
entertained &ldquo;a greater esteem and regard . . .&nbsp; There
is a mystery about him which, wherever he goes, serves not a
little to increase the sensation naturally created by his
appearance and manner.&rdquo; <a name="citation189"></a><a
href="#footnote189" class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; Borrow was
much attracted to this mysterious personage, about whom nothing
could be asserted &ldquo;with downright positiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Seville Borrow proceeded to Cordoba, accompanied by
&ldquo;an elderly person, a Genoese by birth,&rdquo; whose
acquaintance he had made and whom he hoped later to employ in the
distribution of the Testaments.&nbsp; Borrow had hired a couple
of miserable horses.&nbsp; The Genoese had not been in the saddle
for some thirty years, and he was an old man and timid.&nbsp; His
horse soon became aware of this, and neither whip nor spur could
persuade it to exert itself.&nbsp; When approaching night
rendered it necessary to make a special effort to hasten forward,
the bridle of the discontented steed had to be fastened to that
of its fellow, which was then urged forward &ldquo;with spur and
cudgel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both the Genoese and his mount protested
against such drastic measures, the one by entreaties to be
permitted to dismount, the other by attempting to fling itself
down.&nbsp; The only notice Borrow took of these protests was to
spur and cudgel the more.</p>
<p>On the night of the third day the party arrived at Cordoba,
and was cordially welcomed by the Carlist innkeeper, who,
although avowing himself strictly neutral, confessed how great
had been his pleasure at welcoming the Carlists when they
occupied the City a short time before.&nbsp; It was at this inn
that Borrow explained to the elderly Genoese, who had
indiscreetly resented his host&rsquo;s disrespectful remarks
about the young Queen Isabel, how he invariably managed to
preserve good relations with all sorts of factions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am invariably of the
politics of the people at whose table I sit, or beneath whose
roof I sleep; at least I never say anything which can lead them
to suspect the contrary; by pursuing which system I have more
than once escaped a bloody pillow, and having the wine I drank
spiced with sublimate.&rdquo; <a name="citation190a"></a><a
href="#footnote190a" class="citation">[190a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow remained at Cordoba much longer than he had intended,
because of the reports that reached him of the unsafe condition
of the roads.&nbsp; He sent back the old Genoese with the horses,
and spent the time in thoroughly examining the town and making
acquaintances among its inhabitants.&nbsp; At length, after a
stay of ten or eleven days, despairing of any improvement in the
state of the country, he continued his journey in the company of
a <i>contrabandista</i>, temporarily retired from the smuggling
trade, from whom he hired two horses for the sum of forty-two
dollars.&nbsp; Borrow allowed no compunction to assail him as to
the means he employed when he was thoroughly convinced as to the
worthiness of the end he had in view.&nbsp; To further his
projects he would cheerfully have travelled with the Pope
himself.</p>
<p>The journey to Madrid proved dismal in the extreme.&nbsp; The
<i>contrabandista</i> was sullen and gloomy, despite the fact
that his horses had been insured against loss and the handsome
fee he was to receive for his services.&nbsp; The
Despe&ntilde;aperros in the Sierra Morena through which Borrow
had to pass, had, even in times of peace, a most evil reputation;
but by great good luck for Borrow, the local banditti had during
the previous day &ldquo;committed a dreadful robbery and murder
by which they sacked 40,000 <i>reals</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b"
class="citation">[190b]</a>&nbsp; They were in all probability
too busily occupied in dividing their spoil to watch for other
travellers.&nbsp; Another factor that was much in Borrow&rsquo;s
favour was a change in the weather.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Suddenly the Lord breathed forth a frozen
blast,&rdquo; Borrow writes, &ldquo;the severity of which was
almost intolerable.&nbsp; No human being but ourselves ventured
forth.&nbsp; We traversed snow-covered plains, and passed through
villages and towns to all appearance deserted.&nbsp; The robbers
kept close to their caves and hovels, but the cold nearly killed
us.&nbsp; We reached Aranjuez late on Christmas day, and I got
into the house of an Englishman, where I swallowed nearly a pint
of brandy: <a name="citation191a"></a><a href="#footnote191a"
class="citation">[191a]</a> it affected me no more than warm
water.&rdquo; <a name="citation191b"></a><a href="#footnote191b"
class="citation">[191b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow arrived at Madrid on 26th December, having almost by a
miracle avoided death or capture by the human wolves that
infested the country.&nbsp; He took up his quarters at 16 Calle
de Santiago at the house of Maria D&iacute;az, who was to prove
so loyal a friend during many critical periods of his work in
Spain.&nbsp; His first care was to call upon the British
Minister, and enquire if he considered it safe to proceed with
the printing without special application to the new
Government.&nbsp; Mr Villiers&rsquo; answer is interesting, as
showing how thoroughly he had taken Borrow under his
protection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You obtained the permission of the
Government of Isturitz,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;which was a
much less liberal one than the present; I am a witness to the
promise made to you by the former Ministers, which I consider
sufficient; you had best commence and complete the work as soon
as possible without any fresh application, and should anyone
attempt to interrupt you, you have only to come to me, whom you
may command at any time.&rdquo; <a name="citation191c"></a><a
href="#footnote191c" class="citation">[191c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having saved the Bible Society 9000 <i>reals</i> in its paper
bill alone, <a name="citation191d"></a><a href="#footnote191d"
class="citation">[191d]</a> Borrow proceeded to arrange for the
printing.&nbsp; He had already opened negotiations with Charles
Wood, who was associated with Andr&eacute;as Borr&eacute;go, <a
name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a> the most fashionable printer in
Madrid, who not only had the best printing-presses in Spain, but
had been specially recommended by Isturitz.&nbsp; It had been
tentatively arranged that an edition of 5000 copies of the New
Testament should be printed from the version of Father Felipe
Scio de San Miguel, confessor to Ferdinand VII., without notes or
commentaries, and delivered within three months.</p>
<p>Remembering the advice of Isturitz, Borrow determined to
entrust the work to Borr&eacute;go, including the binding.&nbsp;
He was the Government printer, and, furthermore, enjoyed the good
opinion of Mr Villiers.&nbsp; Having persuaded Borr&eacute;go to
reduce his price to 10 <i>reals</i> a sheet, he placed the
order.&nbsp; It was agreed that the work should be completed in
ten weeks from 20th January.</p>
<p>Each sheet was to be passed by Borrow.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact he read every word three times; but in order to insure
absolute accuracy, he engaged the services of Dr Usoz, &ldquo;the
first scholar in Spain,&rdquo; <a name="citation192b"></a><a
href="#footnote192b" class="citation">[192b]</a> who was to be
responsible for the final revision, leaving the question of the
remuneration to the generosity of the Bible Society.&nbsp; The
result of all this care was that, according to Borrow the edition
exhibited scarcely one typographical error. <a
name="citation192c"></a><a href="#footnote192c"
class="citation">[192c]</a></p>
<p>The question of systematic distribution had next to be
considered.&nbsp; After much musing and cogitation, Borrow came
to the conclusion that the only satisfactory method was for him
to &ldquo;ride forth from Madrid into the wildest parts of
Spain,&rdquo; where the word is most wanted and where it seems
next to an impossibility to introduce it, and this he proposed to
the Committee.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will take with me 1200 copies,&rdquo; he
wrote, <a name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a> &ldquo;which I will engage to dispose
of for little or much to the wild people of the wild regions
which I intend to visit; as for the rest of the edition, it must
be disposed of, if possible, in a different way&mdash;I may say
the usual way; part must be entrusted to booksellers, part to
colporteurs, and a dep&ocirc;t must be established at
Madrid.&nbsp; Such work is every person&rsquo;s work, and to
anyone may be confided the execution of it; it is a mere affair
of trade.&nbsp; What I wish to be employed in is what, I am well
aware, no other individual will undertake to do: namely, to
scatter the Word upon the mountains, amongst the valleys and the
inmost recesses of the worst and most dangerous parts of Spain,
where the people are more fierce, fanatic and, in a word,
Carlist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same letter Borrow shows how thoroughly he understood
his own character when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I shall not feel at all surprised should it
[the plan] be disapproved of all-together; but I wish it to be
understood that in that event I could do nothing further than see
the work through the press, as I am confident that whatever
ardour and zeal I at present feel in the cause would desert me
immediately, and that I should neither be able nor willing to
execute anything which might be suggested.&nbsp; I wish to engage
in nothing which would not allow me to depend entirely on
myself.&nbsp; It would be heart-breaking to me to remain at
Madrid expending the Society&rsquo;s money, with almost the
certainty of being informed eventually by the booksellers and
their correspondents that the work has no sale.&nbsp; In a word,
to make sure that some copies find their way among the people, I
must be permitted to carry them to the people myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to inform Mr Brandram that in anticipation of the
acquiescence of the Committee in his schemes, he has purchased,
for about &pound;12, one of the smuggler&rsquo;s horses, which he
has preferred to a mule, on account of the expense of the popular
hybrid, and also because of its enormous appetite, to satisfy
which two pecks of barley and a proportionate amount of straw are
required each twenty-four hours, as the beast must be fed every
four hours, day and night.&nbsp; Thus the members of the
Committee learned something about the ways of the mule.</p>
<p>The response to this suggestion was a resolution passed by the
Sub-Committee for General Purposes, by which Borrow was permitted
to enter into correspondence with the principal booksellers and
other persons favourable to the dissemination of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; In a covering letter <a
name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; Mr Brandram very pertinently
enquired, &ldquo;Can the people in these wilds read?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whilst not wishing to put a final negative to the proposal, the
Secretary asked if there were no middle course.&nbsp; Could
Borrow not establish a dep&ocirc;t at some principal place, and
from it make excursions occupying two or three days each,
&ldquo;instead of devoting yourself wholly to the wild
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow assured Mr Brandram that he had misunderstood.&nbsp;
The care of &ldquo;the wild people&rdquo; was only to be
incidental on his visits to towns and villages to establish
dep&ocirc;ts or agencies.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my way,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;I intended to visit the secret and secluded spots
amongst the rugged hills and mountains, and to talk to the
people, after my manner, of Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation194b"></a><a href="#footnote194b"
class="citation">[194b]</a></p>
<p>It was on 3rd April that Borrow had received the letter from
Earl Street authorising him &ldquo;to undertake the tour
suggested . . . for the purpose of circulating the Spanish New
Testament in some of the principal cities of Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was requested to write as frequently as possible, giving an
account of his adventures.&nbsp; At the same time Mr Brandram
wrote: &ldquo;You will perceive by the Resolution that nearly all
your requests are complied with.&nbsp; You have authority to go
forth with your horses, and may you have a prosperous journey . .
.&nbsp; Pray for wisdom to discern between presumptuousness and
want of Faith.&rdquo; <a name="citation195a"></a><a
href="#footnote195a" class="citation">[195a]</a></p>
<p>The printing of the 5000 copies of the New Testament in
Spanish was completed early in April, but there was considerable
delay over the binding.&nbsp; The actual date of publication was
1st May.&nbsp; The work had been well done, and was
&ldquo;allowed by people who have perused it, and with no
friendly feeling, to be one of the most correct works that have
ever issued from the press in Spain, and to be an exceedingly
favourable specimen of typography and paper.&rdquo; <a
name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the <i>contrabandista&rsquo;s</i> horse, Borrow
had acquired &ldquo;a black Andalusian stallion of great size and
strength, and capable of performing a journey of a hundred
leagues in a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; <a
name="citation195c"></a><a href="#footnote195c"
class="citation">[195c]</a>&nbsp; In spite of his unbroken state,
Borrow decided to purchase the animal, relying upon &ldquo;a
cargo of bibles&rdquo; to reduce him to obedience.&nbsp; It was
with this black Andalusian that he created a sensation by riding
about Madrid, &ldquo;with a Russian skin for a saddle, and
without stirrups.&nbsp; Altogether making so conspicuous a figure
that [the Marqu&eacute;s de] Santa Coloma hesitated, and it
needed all his courage to be seen riding with him.&nbsp; At this
period Borrow spent a good deal of money and lived very freely
(i.e., luxuriously) in Spain.&nbsp; From the point of view of the
Marqu&eacute;s, a Spanish Roman Catholic, Borrow was excessively
bigoted, and fond of attacking Roman Catholics and
Catholicism.&nbsp; He evidently, however, liked him as a
companion; but he says Borrow never, as far as he saw or could
learn, spoke of religion to his Gypsy friends, and that he soon
noticed his difference of attitude towards them.&nbsp; He was
often going to the British Embassy, and he thinks was considered
a great bore there.&rdquo; <a name="citation195d"></a><a
href="#footnote195d" class="citation">[195d]</a></p>
<p>The unanimous advice of Borrow&rsquo;s friends, Protestant and
Roman Catholic, was &ldquo;that for the present I should proceed
with the utmost caution, but without concealing the object of my
mission.&rdquo; <a name="citation196a"></a><a
href="#footnote196a" class="citation">[196a]</a>&nbsp; He was to
avoid offending people&rsquo;s prejudices and endeavour
everywhere to keep on good terms with the clergy, &ldquo;at least
one-third of whom are known to be anxious for the dissemination
of the Word of God, though at the same time unwilling to separate
themselves from the discipline and ceremonials of Rome.&rdquo; <a
name="citation196b"></a><a href="#footnote196b"
class="citation">[196b]</a></p>
<p>Thus equipped with sage counsel, Borrow was just about to
start upon his journey into the North, when he found it necessary
to dismiss his servant owing to misconduct.&nbsp; This caused
delay.&nbsp; Through Mr O&rsquo;Shea, the banker, he got to know
Antonio Buchini, the Greek of Constantinople, who, of all the
strange characters Borrow had met he considered &ldquo;the most
surprising.&rdquo; <a name="citation196c"></a><a
href="#footnote196c" class="citation">[196c]</a>&nbsp;
Antonio&rsquo;s vices were sufficiently obvious to discourage
anyone from attempting to discover his virtues.&nbsp; He loved
change, quarrelled with everybody, masters, mistresses, and
fellow-servants.&nbsp; Borrow engaged him; but looked to the
future with misgiving.&nbsp; Antonio unquestionably had his bad
points; yet he was a treasure compared with the Spaniard whom he
succeeded.&nbsp; This man was much given to drink and was always
engaged in some quarrel.&nbsp; He drew his terrible knife, such
as all Spaniards carry, upon all who offended him.&nbsp; On one
occasion Borrow saved from his wrath a poor maid-servant who had
incurred his ire by burning a herring she was toasting for
him.&nbsp; Antonio&rsquo;s virtues comprised an unquestioned
honesty and devotion, and on the whole he was a desirable servant
in a country where such virtues were extremely rare.</p>
<p>It was not until 15th May that Borrow, accompanied by Antonio,
was able to get away from Madrid.&nbsp; A few days previously he
had contracted &ldquo;a severe cold which terminated in a
shrieking, disagreeable cough.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, following on a
fortnight&rsquo;s attack of influenza, proved difficult to shake
off.&nbsp; Finding himself scarcely able to stand, he at length
appealed to a barber-surgeon, who drew 16 oz. of blood, assuring
his patient that on the following day he would be well enough to
start.</p>
<p>That same evening Mr Villiers sent round to Borrow&rsquo;s
lodgings informing him that he had decided to help him by every
means in his power.&nbsp; He announced his intention of
purchasing a large number of the Testaments, and despatching them
to the various British Consuls in Spain, with instructions
&ldquo;to employ all the means which their official situation
should afford them to circulate the books in question, and to
assure their being noticed.&rdquo; <a name="citation197a"></a><a
href="#footnote197a" class="citation">[197a]</a>&nbsp; They were
also to render every assistance in their power to Borrow
&ldquo;as a friend of Mr Villiers, and a person in the success of
whose enterprise he himself took the warmest interest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation197b"></a><a href="#footnote197b"
class="citation">[197b]</a>&nbsp; Mr Villiers&rsquo; interest in
Borrow&rsquo;s mission seems to have led him into a diplomatic
indiscretion.&nbsp; Borrow himself confesses that he could
scarcely believe his ears.&nbsp; Although assured of the British
Minister&rsquo;s friendly attitude, he &ldquo;could never expect
that he would come forward in so noble, and to say the least of
it, considering his high diplomatic situation, so bold and
decided a manner.&rdquo; <a name="citation197c"></a><a
href="#footnote197c" class="citation">[197c]</a>&nbsp; This act
of friendliness becomes a personal tribute to Borrow, when it is
remembered that at first Mr Villiers had been by no means well
disposed towards the Bible Society.</p>
<p>Before leaving Madrid, Borrow had circularised all the
principal booksellers, offering to supply the New Testament at
fifteen <i>reals</i> a copy, the actual cost price; but he was
not sanguine as to the result, for he found the Spaniard
&ldquo;short-sighted and . . . so utterly unacquainted with the
rudiments of business.&rdquo; <a name="citation198"></a><a
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a>&nbsp;
Advertisements had been inserted in all the principal newspapers
stating that the booksellers of Madrid were now in a position to
supply the New Testament in Spanish, unencumbered by obscuring
notes and comments.&nbsp; Borrow also provided for an
advertisement to be inserted each week during his absence, which
he anticipated would be about five months.&nbsp; After that he
knew not what would happen&mdash;there was always China.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
MAY&ndash;OCTOBER 1837</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prediction of the
surgeon-barber was fulfilled; by the next morning the fever and
cough had considerably abated, although the patient was still
weak from loss of blood.&nbsp; This, however, did not hinder him
from mounting his black Andalusian, and starting upon his initial
journey of distribution.&nbsp; On arriving at Salamanca, his
first objective, he immediately sought out the principal
bookseller and placed with him copies of the New Testament.&nbsp;
He also inserted an advertisement in the local newspaper, stating
that the volume was the only guide to salvation; at the same time
he called attention to the great pecuniary sacrifices that the
Bible Society was making in order to proclaim Christ
crucified.&nbsp; This advertisement he caused to be struck off in
considerable numbers as bills and posted in various parts of the
town, and he even went so far as to affix one to the porch of the
church.&nbsp; He also distributed them as he progressed through
the villages. <a name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a></p>
<p>From Salamanca (10th June) Borrow journeyed to Valladolid, and
from thence to Le&oacute;n, <a name="citation200a"></a><a
href="#footnote200a" class="citation">[200a]</a> (a hotbed of
Carlism), where the people were ignorant and brutal and refused
to the stranger a glass of water, unless he were prepared to pay
for it.&nbsp; At Le&oacute;n he was seized by a fever that
prostrated him for a week.&nbsp; He also experienced marked
antagonism from the clergy, who threatened every direful
consequence to whosoever read or purchased &ldquo;the accursed
books&rdquo; which he brought.&nbsp; A more serious evidence of
their displeasure was shown by the action they commenced in the
ecclesiastical court against the bookseller whom Borrow had
arranged with to act as agent for his Testaments.&nbsp; The
bookseller himself did not mend matters by fixing upon the doors
of the cathedral itself one of the advertisements that he had
received with the books.</p>
<p>When sufficiently recovered to travel, Borrow proceeded to
Astorga, which he reached with the utmost difficulty owing to bad
roads and the fierce heat.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We were compelled to take up our
abode,&rdquo; he writes, <a name="citation200b"></a><a
href="#footnote200b" class="citation">[200b]</a> &ldquo;in a
wretched hovel full of pigs&rsquo; vermin and misery, and from
this place I write, for this morning I felt myself unable to
proceed on my journey, being exhausted with illness, fatigue and
want of food, for scarcely anything is to be obtained; but I
return God thanks and glory for being permitted to undergo these
crosses and troubles for His Word&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I would not
exchange my present situation, unenviable as some may think it,
for a throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Borrow wrote when burning with fever, after having just
been told to vacate his room at the <i>posada</i>, and having his
luggage flung into the yard to make room for the occupants of the
&ldquo;waggon&rdquo; from Madrid to Coru&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>From Astorga he proceeded by way of Puerto de Manzan&aacute;l,
Bembibre, Cacab&eacute;los, Villafranca, Puerto de
Fuencebad&oacute;n and Nog&aacute;les, &ldquo;through the wildest
mountains and wildernesses&rdquo; to Lugo.</p>
<p>Owing to the unsafety of the roads, it was customary for
travellers to attach themselves to the Grand Post, which was
always guarded by an escort.&nbsp; At Nog&aacute;les Borrow
joined the mail courier; but as a rule he was too independent,
too much in a hurry, and too indifferent to danger to wait for
such protection against the perils of the robber-infested
roads.&nbsp; He has given the following graphic account &ldquo;of
the grand post from Madrid to Coru&ntilde;a, attended by a
considerable escort, and an immense number of travellers . . . We
were soon mounted and in the street, amidst a confused throng of
men and quadrupeds.&nbsp; The light of a couple of flambeaus,
which were borne before the courier, shone on the arms of several
soldiers, seemingly drawn up on either side of the road; the
darkness, however, prevented me from distinguishing objects very
clearly.&nbsp; The courier himself was mounted on a little shaggy
pony; before and behind him were two immense portmanteaus, or
leather sacks, the ends of which nearly touched the ground.&nbsp;
For about a quarter of an hour there was much hubbub, shouting,
and trampling, at the end of which period the order was given to
proceed.&nbsp; Scarcely had we left the village when the
flambeaus were extinguished, and we were left in almost total
darkness.&nbsp; In this manner we proceeded for several hours, up
hill and down dale, but generally at a very slow pace.&nbsp; The
soldiers who escorted us from time to time sang patriotic songs .
. . At last the day began to break, and I found myself amidst a
train of two or three hundred people, some on foot, but the
greater part mounted, either on mules or the pony mares: I could
not distinguish a single horse except my own and
Antonio&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A few soldiers were thinly scattered along
the road.&rdquo; <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a></p>
<p>After about a week&rsquo;s stay at Lugo, Borrow again attached
himself to the Grand Post; but tiring of its slow and deliberate
progress, he decided to push on alone, and came very near to
falling a prey to the banditti.&nbsp; He was suddenly confronted
by two of the fraternity, who presented their carbines,
&ldquo;which they probably intended to discharge into my body,
but they took fright at the noise of Antonio&rsquo;s horse, who
was following a little way behind.&rdquo; <a
name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a></p>
<p>The night was spent at Betanzos, where the black Andalusian
was stricken with &ldquo;a deep, hoarse cough.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Remembering a prophetic remark that had been made by a roadside
acquaintance to the effect that &ldquo;the man must be mad who
brings a horse to Galicia, and doubly so he who brings an
<i>entero</i>,&rdquo; Borrow, determined to have the animal bled,
sent for a farrier, meanwhile rubbing down his steed with a quart
of <i>anis</i> brandy.&nbsp; The farrier demanded an ounce of
gold for the operation, which decided Borrow to perform it
himself.&nbsp; With a large fleam that he possessed, he twice
bled the Andalusian, to the astonishment of the discomfited
farrier, and saved its valuable life, also an ounce of
gold.&nbsp; Next day he and Antonio walked to Coru&ntilde;a,
leading their horses.</p>
<p>At Coru&ntilde;a were five hundred copies of the New Testament
that had been sent on from Madrid.&nbsp; So far Borrow had
himself disposed of sixty-five copies, irrespective of those sold
at Lugo and other places by means of the advertisement.&nbsp;
These books were all sold at prices ranging from 10 to 12
<i>reals</i> each.&nbsp; Borrow made a special point of this,
&ldquo;to give a direct lie to the assertion&rdquo; that the
Bible Society, having no vent for the Bibles and New Testaments
it printed, was forced either to give them away or sell them by
auction, when they were purchased as waste paper.</p>
<p>The condition of the roads at that period was so bad, on
account of robbers and Carlists, that it was forbidden to anyone
to travel along the thoroughfare leading to Santiago unless in
company with the mail courier and his escort of soldiers.&nbsp;
Unfortunately for Borrow his black Andalusian was not of a
companionable disposition, and to bring him near other horses was
to invite a fierce contest.&nbsp; On the rare occasions that he
did travel with the Grand Post, Borrow was frequently involved in
difficulties on account of the <i>entero&rsquo;s</i> unsociable
nature; but as he was deeply attached to the noble beast, he
retained him and suffered dangers rather than give up the
companion of many an adventure.</p>
<p>Some idea may be obtained of the state of rural Spain in 1837,
when the highways teemed with &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; bent upon
robbing friend and foe alike and afterwards assassinating or
mutilating their victims, from a story that Borrow tells of how a
viper-catcher, who was engaged in pursuing his calling in the
neighbourhood of Orense, fell into the hands of these miscreants,
who robbed and stripped him.&nbsp; They then pinioned his hands
behind him and drew over his head the mouth of the bag containing
the <i>living</i> vipers, which they fastened round his neck and
listened with satisfaction to the poor wretch&rsquo;s
cries.&nbsp; The reptiles stung their victim to madness, and
after having run raving through several villages he eventually
fell dead. <a name="citation203a"></a><a href="#footnote203a"
class="citation">[203a]</a></p>
<p>Making Coru&ntilde;a his headquarters, Borrow proceeded to
Santiago, &ldquo;travelling with the courier or weekly
post,&rdquo; and from thence to Padr&oacute;n, Pontevedra, and
Vigo.&nbsp; At Vigo he was apprehended as a spy, but immediately
released.&nbsp; It was whilst at Santiago that he repeated an
experiment he had previously made at Valladolid.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I . . . sallied forth,&rdquo; he writes, <a
name="citation203b"></a><a href="#footnote203b"
class="citation">[203b]</a> &ldquo;alone and on horseback, and
bent my course to a distant village; on my arrival, which took
place just after the <i>siesta</i> or afternoon&rsquo;s nap had
concluded, I proceeded . . . to the market place, where I spread
a horse-cloth on the ground, upon which I deposited my
books.&nbsp; I then commenced crying with a loud voice:
&lsquo;Peasants, peasants, I bring you the Word of God at a cheap
price.&nbsp; I know you have but little money, but I bring it you
at whatever you can command, at four or three <i>reals</i>,
according to your means.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thus went on till a crowd
gathered round me, who examined the books with attention, many of
them reading aloud, but I had not long to wait; . . . my cargo
was disposed of almost instantaneously, and I mounted my horse
without a question being asked me, and returned to my temporary
abode lighter than I came.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow did not repeat the experiment for fear of giving
offence to the clergy.&nbsp; The new means of distribution was to
be used only as a last resource.</p>
<p>Arriving at Padr&oacute;n on the return journey, Borrow found
that he had only one book left.&nbsp; He determined to send
Antonio forward with the horses to await him at Coru&ntilde;a,
whilst he made an excursion to Cape Finisterre.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;difficult to assign any plausible reason for the ardent
desire which I entertained to visit this place; but I remembered
that last year I had escaped almost by a miracle from shipwreck
and death on the rocky sides of this extreme point of the Old
World, and I thought that to convey the Gospel to a place so wild
and remote might perhaps be considered an acceptable pilgrimage
in the eyes of my Maker.&rdquo; <a name="citation204a"></a><a
href="#footnote204a" class="citation">[204a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiring a guide and a pony, he reached the Cape, after
surmounting tremendous difficulties, and on arrival he and his
guide were arrested as Carlist spies. <a
name="citation204b"></a><a href="#footnote204b"
class="citation">[204b]</a>&nbsp; In all probability he would
have been shot, such was the certainty of the <i>Alcalde</i> that
he was a spy, had not the professional hero of the place come
forward and, after having cross-examined him as to his knowledge
of &ldquo;knife&rdquo; and &ldquo;fork,&rdquo; the only two
English words the Spaniard knew, pronounced him English, and
eventually conveyed him to the <i>Alcalde</i> of Convucion, who
released him.&nbsp; On the man who had saved him Borrow privately
bestowed a gratuity, and publicly the copy of the New Testament
that had led to the expedition.&nbsp; He then returned to
Coru&ntilde;a, by his journey having accomplished &ldquo;what has
long been one of the ardent wishes of my heart.&nbsp; I have
carried the Gospel to the extreme point of the Old World.&rdquo;
<a name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a"
class="citation">[205a]</a></p>
<p>The black Andalusian was totally unfitted for the long
mountainous journey into the Asturias that Borrow now planned to
undertake, and he decided to dispose of him.&nbsp; He was greatly
attached to the creature, notwithstanding his vicious habits and
the difficulties that arose out of them.&nbsp; Now the
<i>entero</i> would be engaged in a deadly struggle with some
gloomy mule; again, by rushing among a crowd outside a
<i>posada</i>, he would do infinite damage and earn for his
master and himself an evil name.&nbsp; Borrow thus announces to
the Bible Society the sale of its property: &ldquo;This animal
cost the Society about 2000 <i>reals</i> at Madrid; I, however,
sold him for 3000 at Coru&ntilde;a, notwithstanding that he has
suffered much from the hard labour which he had been subjected to
in our wanderings in Galicia, and likewise from bad
provender.&rdquo; <a name="citation205b"></a><a
href="#footnote205b" class="citation">[205b]</a></p>
<p>Borrow next set out upon an expedition to Orviedo in the
Asturias, <a name="citation205c"></a><a href="#footnote205c"
class="citation">[205c]</a> then in daily expectation of being
attacked by the Carlists.&nbsp; It was at Orviedo that he
received a striking tribute from a number of Spanish
gentlemen.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A strange adventure has just occurred to
me,&rdquo; he wrote. <a name="citation205d"></a><a
href="#footnote205d" class="citation">[205d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am in the ancient town of Orviedo, in a very large, scantily
furnished and remote room of an ancient <i>posada</i>, formerly a
palace of the Counts of Santa Cruz, it is past ten at night and
the rain is descending in torrents.&nbsp; I ceased writing on
hearing numerous footsteps ascending the creeking stairs which
lead to my apartment&mdash;the door was flung open, and in walked
nine men of tall stature, marshalled by a little hunchbacked
personage.&nbsp; They were all muffled in the long cloaks of
Spain, but I instantly knew by their demeanour that they were
<i>caballeros</i>, or gentlemen.&nbsp; They placed themselves in
a rank before the table where I was sitting; suddenly and
simultaneously they all flung back their cloaks, and I perceived
that every one bore a book in his hand, a book which I knew full
well.&nbsp; After a pause, which I was unable to break, for I sat
lost in astonishment and almost conceived myself to be visited by
apparitions, the hunchback advancing somewhat before the rest,
said, in soft silvery tones, &lsquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Cavalier,
was it you who brought this book to the Asturias?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
now supposed that they were the civil authorities of the place
come to take me into custody, and, rising from my seat, I
exclaimed: &lsquo;It certainly was I, and it is my glory to have
done so; the book is the New Testament of God; I wish it was in
my power to bring a million.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I heartily wish
so too,&rsquo; said the little personage with a sigh; &lsquo;be
under no apprehension, Sir Cavalier, these gentlemen are my
friends.&nbsp; We have just purchased these books in the shop
where you have placed them for sale, and have taken the liberty
of calling upon you in order to return you our thanks for the
treasure you have brought us.&nbsp; I hope you can furnish us
with the Old Testament also!&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied that I was
sorry to inform him that at present it was entirely out of my
power to comply with his wish, as I had no Old Testaments in my
possession, but I did not despair of procuring some speedily from
England. <a name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a>&nbsp; He then asked me a great many
questions concerning my Biblical travels in Spain and my success,
and the views entertained by the Society in respect to Spain,
adding that he hoped we should pay particular attention to the
Asturias, which he assured me was the best ground in the
Peninsula for our labour.&nbsp; After about half an hour&rsquo;s
conversation, he suddenly said in the English language,
&lsquo;Good night, Sir,&rsquo; wrapped his cloak around him and
walked out as he had come.&nbsp; His companions, who had hitherto
not uttered a word, all repeated, &lsquo;Good night, Sir,&rsquo;
and adjusting their cloaks followed him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This anecdote greatly impressed the General Committee.&nbsp;
Mr Brandram wrote (15th November 1837): &ldquo;We were all deeply
interested with your ten gentlemen of Orviedo.&nbsp; I have
introduced them at several meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst at Orviedo, Borrow began to be very uneasy about the
state of affairs at the capital.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madrid,&rdquo; he
wrote, <a name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a> &ldquo;is the dep&ocirc;t of our
books, and I am apprehensive that in the revolutions and
disturbances which at present seem to threaten it, our whole
stock may perish.&nbsp; True it is that in order to reach Madrid
I should have to pass through the midst of the Carlist hordes,
who would perhaps slay or make me prisoner; but I am at present
so much accustomed to perilous adventure, and have hitherto
experienced so many fortunate escapes, that the dangers which
infest the route would not deter me a moment from
venturing.&nbsp; But there is no certain intelligence, and Madrid
may be in safety or on the brink of falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another factor that made him desirous of returning to the
capital was that, ever since leaving Coru&ntilde;a, he had been
afflicted with a dysentery and, later, with ophthalmia, which
resulted from it, and he was anxious to obtain proper medical
advice.&nbsp; He determined, however, first to carry out his
project of visiting Santand&eacute;r, which he reached by way of
Villa Viciosa, Colunga, Riba de Sella, Ll&aacute;nes, Colombres,
San Vicente, Santillana.&nbsp; It was at Santand&eacute;r that he
encountered the unfortunate Flinter, <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a> as brave with his
sword as with his tongue.</p>
<p>Instructions had been given in a letter to Borr&eacute;go to
forward to Santand&eacute;r two hundred copies of the New
Testament; but, much to Borrow&rsquo;s disappointment, he found
that they had not arrived.&nbsp; He thought that either they had
fallen into the hands of the Carlists, or his letter of
instruction had miscarried: as a matter of fact they did not
leave Madrid until 30th October, the day before Borrow arrived at
the capital.&nbsp; Thus his journey was largely wasted.&nbsp; It
would be folly to remain at Santand&eacute;r, where, in spite of
the strictest economy, his expenses amounted to two pounds a day,
whilst a further supply of books was obtained.&nbsp; Accordingly
he determined to make for Madrid without further delay.</p>
<p>Purchasing a small horse, and notwithstanding that he was so
ill as scarcely to be able to support himself; indifferent to the
fact that the country between Santand&eacute;r and Madrid was
overrun with Carlists, whose affairs in Castile had not
prospered; too dispirited to collect his thoughts sufficiently to
write to Mr Brandram, he set out, accompanied by Antonio,
&ldquo;determined to trust, as usual, in the Almighty and to
venture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Physical ailments, however, did not in any
way cause him to forget why he had come to Santand&eacute;r, and
before leaving he made tentative arrangements with the
booksellers of the town as to what they should do in the event of
his being able to send them a supply of Testaments.</p>
<p>That journey of a hundred leagues was a nightmare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Robberies, murders, and all kinds of atrocity were
perpetrated before, behind, and on both sides&rdquo; of them; but
they passed through it all as if travelling along an English
highway.&nbsp; Even when met at the entrance of the Black Pass by
a man, his face covered with blood, who besought him not to enter
the pass, where he had just been robbed of all he possessed,
Borrow, without making reply, proceeded on his way.&nbsp; He was
too ill to weigh the risks, and Antonio followed cheerfully
wherever his master went.&nbsp; Madrid was reached on 31st
October. <a name="citation209a"></a><a href="#footnote209a"
class="citation">[209a]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day Borrow wrote
to Mr Brandram: &ldquo;People say we have been very lucky;
Antonio says, &lsquo;It was so written&rsquo;; but I say, Glory
be to the Lord for His mercies vouchsafed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expedition to the Northern Provinces had occupied five and
a half months.&nbsp; Every kind of fatigue had been experienced,
dangers had been faced, even courted, and every incident of the
road turned to further the end in view&mdash;the distribution of
the Scriptures in Spain.&nbsp; The countryside had proved itself
ignorant and superstitious, and the towns eager, not for the Word
of God but &ldquo;for stimulant narratives, and amongst too many
a lust for the deistical writings of the French, especially for
those of Talleyrand, which have been translated into Spanish and
published by the press of Barcelona, and for which I was
frequently pestered.&rdquo; <a name="citation209b"></a><a
href="#footnote209b" class="citation">[209b]</a>&nbsp; Antonio
had proved himself a unique body-servant and companion, and if
with a previous employer he had valued his personal comfort so
highly as to give notice because his mistress&rsquo;s pet quail
disturbed his slumbers, he was nevertheless utterly indifferent
to the hardships and discomforts that he endured when with
Borrow, and always proved cheerful and willing.</p>
<p>Borrow had &ldquo;by private sale disposed of one hundred and
sixteen Testaments to individuals entirely of the lower classes,
namely, muleteers, carmen, <i>contrabandistas</i>, etc.&rdquo; <a
name="citation209c"></a><a href="#footnote209c"
class="citation">[209c]</a>&nbsp; He had dared to undertake what
perhaps only he was capable of carrying to a successful issue;
for, left alone to make his own plans and conduct the campaign
along his own lines, Borrow has probably never been equalled as a
missionary, strange though the term may seem when applied to
him.&nbsp; His fear of God did not hinder him from making other
men fear God&rsquo;s instrument, himself.&nbsp; His fine capacity
for affairs, together with what must have appeared to the clergy
of the districts through which he passed his outrageous daring,
conspired to his achieving what few other men would have thought,
and probably none were capable of undertaking.&nbsp; A missionary
who rode a noble, black Andalusian stallion, who could use a
fleam as well as a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer, who could ride
barebacked, and, above all, made men fear him as a physical
rather than a spiritual force, was new in Spain, as indeed
elsewhere.&nbsp; The very novelty of Borrow&rsquo;s methods,
coupled with the daring and unconventional independence of the
man himself, ensured the success of his mission.&nbsp; There was
something of the Camel-Driver of Mecca about his missionary
work.&nbsp; He saw nothing anomalous in being possessed of a
strong arm as well as a Christian spirit.&nbsp; He would
endeavour to win over the ungodly; but woe betide them if they
should attempt to pit their strength against his.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s own comment upon his journey in the Northern
Provinces was, &ldquo;Insignificant are the results of
man&rsquo;s labours compared with the swelling ideas of his
presumption; something, however, had been effected by the journey
which I had just concluded.&rdquo; <a name="citation210"></a><a
href="#footnote210" class="citation">[210]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
NOVEMBER 1837&ndash;APRIL 1838</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> changes had taken place in
Madrid during Borrow&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; The Carlists had
actually appeared before its gates, although they had
subsequently retired.&nbsp; Liberalism had been routed and a
<i>Moderado</i> Cabinet, under the leadership of Count Ofalia,
ruled the city and such part of the country as was sufficiently
complaisant as to permit itself to be ruled.&nbsp; As the
<i>Moderados</i> represented the Court faction, Borrow saw that
he had little to expect from them.&nbsp; He was unacquainted with
any of the members of the Cabinet, and, what was far more serious
for him, the relations between the new Government and Sir George
Villiers <a name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a> were none too cordial, as the British
Minister had been by no means favourable to the new ministry.</p>
<p>Having written to Mr Brandram telling of his arrival in
Madrid, &ldquo;begging pardon for all errors of commission and
omission,&rdquo; and confessing himself &ldquo;a frail and
foolish vessel,&rdquo; that had &ldquo;accomplished but a slight
portion of what I proposed in my vanity,&rdquo; Borrow proceeded
to disprove his own assertion.&nbsp; He found the affairs of the
Bible Society in a far from flourishing condition.&nbsp; The
Testaments had not sold to any considerable extent, for which
&ldquo;only circumstances and the public poverty&rdquo; were the
cause, as Dr Usoz explained.</p>
<p>To awaken interest in his campaign, Borrow planned to print a
thousand advertisements, which were to be posted in various parts
of the city, and to employ colporteurs to vend the books in the
streets.&nbsp; He despatched consignments of books to towns he
had visited that required them, and in the enthusiasm of his
eager and active mind foresaw that, &ldquo;as the circle widens
in the lake into which a stripling has cast a pebble, so will the
circle of our usefulness continue widening, until it has embraced
the whole vast region of Spain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation212a"></a><a href="#footnote212a"
class="citation">[212a]</a></p>
<p>It soon became evident that there was to be a very strong
opposition.&nbsp; A furious attack upon the Bible Society was
made in a letter addressed to the editors of <i>El
Espa&ntilde;ol</i> on 5th November, prefixed to a circular of the
Spiritual Governor of Valencia, forbidding the purchase or
reading of the London edition of Father Scio&rsquo;s Bible.&nbsp;
The letter described the Bible Society as &ldquo;an infernal
society,&rdquo; and referred in passing to &ldquo;its accursed
fecundity.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also strongly resented the omission of
the Apocrypha from the Scio Bible.&nbsp; Borrow promptly replied
to this attack in a letter of great length, and entirely silenced
his antagonist, whom he described to Mr Brandram (20th Nov.) as
&ldquo;an unprincipled benefice-hunting curate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will doubtless deem it too warm and fiery,&rdquo; he
writes, referring to his reply, &ldquo;but tameness and
gentleness are of little avail when surrounded by the vassal
slaves of bloody Rome.&rdquo; <a name="citation212b"></a><a
href="#footnote212b" class="citation">[212b]</a>&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s response to the &ldquo;benefice-hunting
curate&rdquo; not only silenced him, but was listened to by the
General Committee of the Society &ldquo;with much
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cause of the trouble in Valencia lay with the other agent
of the Bible Society in Spain, Lieutenant James Newenham Graydon,
R.N., who first took up the work of distributing the Scriptures
at Gibraltar in 1835.&nbsp; Here he became associated with the
Rev. W. H. Rule, of the Wesleyan Methodist Society.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lieutenant, who seems to have combined the personal
charm of the Irish gentleman with some of the perfervid
incautiousness of the Keltic temperament, finding himself
unemployed at Gibraltar, resolved to do what lay in his power for
the spiritual enlightenment of Spain.&nbsp; Without receiving a
regular commission from any society, he took up single-handed the
task which he had imposed upon himself.&rdquo; <a
name="citation213a"></a><a href="#footnote213a"
class="citation">[213a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow had first met Lieutenant Graydon at Madrid, in the
summer of 1836, where he saw him two or three times.&nbsp; When
Graydon left, on account of the heat, Borrow had removed to
Graydon&rsquo;s lodgings as being more comfortable than his
own.&nbsp; The prohibition in Valencia was directly due to the
indiscretion and incaution of Graydon.&nbsp; The Vicar-General of
the province gave as a reason for his action, an advertisement
that had appeared in the <i>Diario Comercial</i> of Valencia,
undertaking to supply Bibles gratis to those who could not afford
to buy them.&nbsp; For this advertisement Graydon was admonished
by the General Committee, which refused to entertain his plea
that, being unpaid, he was not, strictly speaking, an agent of
the Bible Society.&nbsp; He was given to understand that as the
Society was responsible for his acts he must be guided by its
views and wishes.</p>
<p>The next occasion on which Borrow came into conflict with this
impulsive missionary free-lance was in March 1838, when he heard
from the Rev. W. H. Rule that Graydon was on his way to
Andalusia.&nbsp; Borrow immediately wrote to Mr Brandram that he,
acting on the advice of Sir George Villiers, had already planned
an expedition into that province, and furthermore that he had
despatched there a number of Testaments.&nbsp; He explained to Mr
Brandram that he was apprehensive &ldquo;of the re-acting at
Seville of the Valencian Drama, which I have such unfortunate
cause to rue, as I am the victim on whom an aggravated party have
wreaked their vengeance, and for the very cogent reason that I
was within their reach.&rdquo; <a name="citation213b"></a><a
href="#footnote213b" class="citation">[213b]</a>&nbsp; On this
occasion Graydon was instructed not to start upon his projected
journey, although Mr Brandram gave the order much against his own
inclination. <a name="citation214a"></a><a href="#footnote214a"
class="citation">[214a]</a></p>
<p>One great difficulty that Borrow had to contend with was the
apathy of the Madrid booksellers, who &ldquo;gave themselves no
manner of trouble to secure the sale, and even withheld [the]
advertisements from the public.&rdquo; <a
name="citation214b"></a><a href="#footnote214b"
class="citation">[214b]</a>&nbsp; This determined him to open a
shop himself, and, accordingly, towards the end of November, he
secured premises in the Calle del Principe, one of the main
thoroughfares, for which he agreed to pay a rent of eight
<i>reals</i> a day.&nbsp; He furnished the premises handsomely,
with glass cases and chandeliers, and caused to be painted in
large yellow characters the sign &ldquo;Despacho de la Sociedad
B&iacute;blica y Estrangera&rdquo; (Dep&ocirc;t of the Biblical
and Foreign Society).&nbsp; He engaged a Gallegan (Jos&eacute;
Calzado, whom he called Pepe) as salesman, and on 27th November
formally opened his new premises.&nbsp; Customers soon presented
themselves; but many were disappointed on finding that they could
not obtain the Bible.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could have sold ten times
the amount of what I did,&rdquo; Borrow writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>must</i> therefore be furnished with Bibles instanter; send me
therefore the London edition, bad as it is, say 500
copies.&rdquo; <a name="citation214c"></a><a href="#footnote214c"
class="citation">[214c]</a></p>
<p>To facilitate the passing of these books through the customs,
Borrow suggested that they should be consigned to the British
Consul at Cadiz, who was friendly to the Society and &ldquo;would
have sufficient influence to secure their admission into
Spain.&nbsp; But the most advisable way,&rdquo; he goes on to
explain with great guile, &ldquo;would be to pack them in two
chests, placing at the top Bibles in English and other languages,
for there is a demand, viz., 100 English, 100 French, 50 German,
50 Hebrew, 50 Greek, 10 Modern Greek, 10 Persian, 20
Arabic.&nbsp; <i>Pray do not fail</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation215a"></a><a href="#footnote215a"
class="citation">[215a]</a></p>
<p>When Sir George Villiers first obtained from Isturitz
permission for Borrow to print and sell the New Testament in
Spanish without notes, he had cautioned him &ldquo;to use the
utmost circumspection, and in order to pursue his vocation with
success, to avoid offending popular prejudices, which would not
fail to be excited against a Protestant and a Foreigner engaged
in the propagation of the Gospel.&rdquo; <a
name="citation215b"></a><a href="#footnote215b"
class="citation">[215b]</a>&nbsp; This warning the British
Minister had repeated frequently since.&nbsp; It was without
consulting Sir George that Borrow opened his dep&ocirc;t, and
&ldquo;imprudently painted upon the window that it was the
Dep&ocirc;t of the London (sic) Bible Society for the sale of
Bibles.&nbsp; I told him,&rdquo; Sir George writes &ldquo;that
such a measure would render the interference of the Authorities
inevitable, and so it turned out.&rdquo; <a
name="citation215c"></a><a href="#footnote215c"
class="citation">[215c]</a></p>
<p>Borrow now lost the services of the faithful Antonio, who, on
the last day of the year, informed him that he had become
unsettled and dissatisfied with everything at his master&rsquo;s
lodgings, including the house, the furniture, and the landlady
herself.&nbsp; Therefore he had hired himself out to a count for
four dollars a month less than he was receiving from Borrow,
because he was &ldquo;fond of change, though it be for the
worse.&nbsp; <i>Adieu</i>, <i>mon maitre</i>,&rdquo; he said in
parting; &ldquo;may you be as well served as you deserve.&nbsp;
Should you chance, however, to have any pressing need <i>de mes
soins</i>, send for me without hesitation, and I will at once
give my new master warning.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days later Borrow
engaged a Basque, named Francisco, who &ldquo;to the strength of
a giant joined the disposition of a lamb,&rdquo; <a
name="citation216a"></a><a href="#footnote216a"
class="citation">[216a]</a> and who had been strongly recommended
to him.</p>
<p>On his return from a hurried visit to Toledo, Borrow found his
<i>Despacho</i> succeeding as well as could be expected.&nbsp; To
call attention to his premises he now took an extremely daring
step.&nbsp; He caused to be printed three thousand copies of an
advertisement on paper yellow, blue, and crimson, &ldquo;with
which I almost covered the sides of the streets&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;and besides this inserted notices in all the journals and
periodicals, employing also a man, after the London fashion, to
parade the streets with a placard, to the astonishment of the
populace.&rdquo; <a name="citation216b"></a><a
href="#footnote216b" class="citation">[216b]</a>&nbsp; The result
of this move, Borrow declared, was that every man, woman and
child in Madrid became aware of the existence of his
<i>Despacho</i>, as well they might.&nbsp; In spite of this
commercial enterprise, the first month&rsquo;s trading showed a
sale of only between seventy and eighty New Testaments, and ten
Bibles, <a name="citation216c"></a><a href="#footnote216c"
class="citation">[216c]</a> these having been secured from a
Spanish bookseller who had brought them secretly from Gibraltar,
but who was afraid to sell them himself.&nbsp; Mr
Brandram&rsquo;s comment upon the letter from Borrow telling of
the posters was that its contents had &ldquo;afforded us no
little merriment.&nbsp; The idea of your placards and
placard-bearers in Madrid is indeed a novel one.&nbsp; It cannot
but be effectual in giving publicity.&nbsp; I sincerely hope it
may not be prejudicial.&rdquo; <a name="citation216d"></a><a
href="#footnote216d" class="citation">[216d]</a></p>
<p>When in England, at the end of 1836, Borrow had been
authorised by the Bible Society to find &ldquo;a person competent
to translate the Scriptures in Basque.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
27<i>th</i> February 1837, he wrote telling Mr Brandram that he
had become &ldquo;acquainted with a gentleman well versed in that
dialect, of which I myself have some knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr
Oteiza, the domestic physician of the Marqu&eacute;s de
Salvatierra, was accordingly commissioned to proceed with the
work, for which, when completed, he was paid the sum of
&ldquo;&pound;8 and a few odd shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
reported to Mr Brandram (7th June 1837):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have examined it with much attention, and
find it a very faithful version.&nbsp; The only objection which
can be brought against it is that Spanish words are frequently
used to express ideas for which there are equivalents in Basque;
but this language, as spoken at present in Spain, is very
corrupt, and a work written entirely in the Basque of
Larramendi&rsquo;s Dictionary would be intelligible to very
few.&nbsp; I have read passages from it to men of Guipuscoa, who
assured me that they had no difficulty in understanding it, and
that it was written in the colloquial style of the
province.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow had &ldquo;obtained a slight acquaintance&rdquo; with
Basque when a youth, which he lost no opportunity of extending by
mingling with Biscayans during his stay in the Peninsula.&nbsp;
He also considerably improved himself in the language by
conversing with his Basque servant Francisco.&nbsp; Borrow now
decided to print the Gitano and Basque versions of St Luke, which
he accordingly put in hand; but as the compositors were entirely
ignorant of both languages, he had to exercise the greatest care
in reading the proofs.</p>
<p>During his stay in Spain he had found time to translate into
the dialect of the Spanish gypsies the greater part of the New
Testament. <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a"
class="citation">[217a]</a>&nbsp; His method had been somewhat
original.&nbsp; Believing that there is &ldquo;no individual,
however wicked and hardened, who is utterly
<i>godless</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation217b"></a><a
href="#footnote217b" class="citation">[217b]</a> he determined to
apply his belief to the gypsies.&nbsp; To enlist their interest
in the work, he determined to allow them to do the translating
themselves.&nbsp; At one period of his residence in Madrid he was
regularly visited by two gypsy women, and these he decided to
make his translators; for he found the women far more amenable
than the men.&nbsp; In spite of the fact that he had already
translated into Gitano the New Testament, or the greater part of
it, he would read out to the women from the Spanish version and
let them translate it into Romany themselves, thus obtaining the
correct gypsy idiom.&nbsp; The women looked forward to these
gatherings and also to &ldquo;the one small glass of
Malaga&rdquo; with which their host regaled them.&nbsp; They had
got as far as the eighth chapter before the meetings ended.&nbsp;
What was the moral effect of St Luke upon the minds of two
gypsies?&nbsp; Borrow confessed himself sceptical; first, because
he was acquainted with the gypsy character; second, because it
came to his knowledge that one of the women &ldquo;committed a
rather daring theft shortly afterwards, which compelled her to
conceal herself for a fortnight.&rdquo; <a
name="citation218a"></a><a href="#footnote218a"
class="citation">[218a]</a>&nbsp; Borrow comforted himself with
the reflection that &ldquo;it is quite possible, however, that
she may remember the contents of those chapters on her
death-bed.&rdquo; <a name="citation218b"></a><a
href="#footnote218b" class="citation">[218b]</a>&nbsp; The
translation of the remaining chapters was supplied from
Borrow&rsquo;s own version begun at Badajos in 1836.</p>
<p>It is not strange that Borrow should be regarded with
suspicion by the Spaniards on account of his association with the
Gitanos.&nbsp; Sometimes there would be as many as seventeen
gypsies gathered together at his lodgings in the Calle de
Santiago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The people in the street in which I
lived,&rdquo; he writes, <a name="citation218c"></a><a
href="#footnote218c" class="citation">[218c]</a> &ldquo;seeing
such numbers of these strange females continually passing in and
out, were struck with astonishment, and demanded the
reason.&nbsp; The answers which they obtained by no means
satisfied them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Zeal for the conversion of
souls&mdash;the souls too of
Git&aacute;nas,&mdash;dispar&aacute;te! the fellow is a
scoundrel.&nbsp; Besides he is an Englishman, and is not
baptised; what cares he for souls?&nbsp; They visit him for other
purposes.&nbsp; He makes base ounces, which they carry away and
circulate.&nbsp; Madrid is already stocked with false
money.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others were of the opinion that we met for
the purposes of sorcery and abomination.&nbsp; The Spaniard has
no conception that other springs of action exist than interest or
villany.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was in reality endeavouring to convey to his
&ldquo;little congregation,&rdquo; as he called them, some idea
of abstract morality.&nbsp; He was bold enough &ldquo;to speak
against their inveterate practices, thieving and lying, telling
fortunes,&rdquo; etc., and at first experienced much
opposition.&nbsp; About the result, he seems to have cherished no
illusions; still, he wrote a hymn in their dialect which he
taught his guests to sing.</p>
<p>For some time past it had been obvious to Borrow that he was
becoming more than ever unpopular with certain interested
factions in Madrid, who looked upon his missionary labours with
angry disapproval.&nbsp; The opening of his <i>Despacho</i> had
caused a great sensation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Priests and Bigots are
teeming with malice and fury,&rdquo; he had written to Mr
Brandram, <a name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a> &ldquo;which hitherto they have
thought proper to exhibit only in words, as they know that all I
do here is favoured by Mr Villiers <a name="citation219b"></a><a
href="#footnote219b" class="citation">[219b]</a> (sic) . .
.&nbsp; There is no attempt, however atrocious, which may not be
expected from such people, and were it right and seemly for
<i>me</i>, the most insignificant of worms, to make such a
comparison, I would say that, like Paul at Ephesus, I am fighting
with wild beasts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was attacked in print and
endeavours were made to incite the people against him as a
sorcerer and companion of gypsies and witches.&nbsp; When he
decided upon the campaign of the posters it would appear, at
first glance, that in the claims of the merchant Borrow had
entirely forgotten the obligations of the diplomatist.&nbsp; On
the other hand, he may have foreseen that the priestly party
would soon force the Government to action, and was desirous of
selling all the books he could before this happened.&nbsp; His
own words seem to indicate that this was the case.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People who know me not,&rdquo; he wrote to
Mr Brandram, &ldquo;nor are acquainted with my situation, may be
disposed to call me rash; but I am far from being so, as I never
adopt a venturous course when any other is open to me; but I am
not a person to be terrified by any danger when I see that
braving it is the only way to achieve an object.&rdquo; <a
name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever may have been Borrow&rsquo;s motives, the crisis
arrived on 12th January, when he received a peremptory order from
the Civil Governor of Madrid (who had previously sent for and
received two copies, to submit for examination to the
Ecclesiastical Authorities) to sell no more of the New Testament
in Spanish without notes.&nbsp; At that period the average sale
was about twenty copies a day.&nbsp; &ldquo;The priests have at
length &lsquo;swooped upon me,&rsquo;&rdquo; Borrow wrote to Mr
Brandram, three days later.&nbsp; The order did not, however,
take him unawares.</p>
<p>Borrow saw that little assistance was to be expected from Sir
George Villiers, who, for obvious reasons, was not popular with
the Ofalia ministry, and, accepting the British Minister&rsquo;s
advice, he promptly complied with the edict.&nbsp; He recognised
that for the time being his enemies were paramount.&nbsp; He
accuses the priests of employing the ruffian who, one night in a
dark street, warned him to discontinue selling his &ldquo;Jewish
books,&rdquo; or he would &ldquo;have a knife &lsquo;<i>nailed in
his heart</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; to which he replied by telling the
fellow to go home, say his prayers and inform his employers that
he, Borrow, pitied them.&nbsp; It was a few days after this
episode that Borrow received the formal notice of
prohibition.</p>
<p>Consoling himself with the fact that he was not ordered to
close his <i>Despacho</i>, and refusing the advice that was
tendered to him to erase from its windows the yellow-lettered
sign, he determined to continue his campaign with the Bibles that
were on their way to him, and the Gitano and Basque versions of
St Luke as soon as they were ready.&nbsp; The prohibition
referred only to the Spanish New Testament without notes, and in
this Borrow took comfort.&nbsp; He had every reason to feel
gratified; for, since opening the <i>Despacho</i>, he had sold
nearly three hundred copies of the New Testament.</p>
<p>At Earl Street it was undoubtedly felt that Borrow had to some
extent precipitated the present crisis.&nbsp; On 8th February Mr
Brandram wrote that, whilst there was no wish on the part of the
Committee to censure him, they were not altogether surprised at
what had occurred; for, when they first heard about them,
&ldquo;some <i>did</i> think that your tri-coloured placards and
placard-bearer were somewhat calculated to provoke what has
occurred.&rdquo;&nbsp; In reply Borrow confessed that the view of
the &ldquo;some&rdquo; gave him &ldquo;a pang, more especially as
I knew from undoubted sources that nothing which I had done,
said, or written, was the original cause of the arbitrary step
which had been adopted in respect to me.&rdquo; <a
name="citation221a"></a><a href="#footnote221a"
class="citation">[221a]</a></p>
<p>The printing of the Gitano and Basque editions of St Luke (500
copies <a name="citation221b"></a><a href="#footnote221b"
class="citation">[221b]</a> of each) was completed in March, and
they were published respectively in March and April.&nbsp; The
Gitano version attracted much attention.&nbsp; Some months later
Borrow wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No work printed in Spain ever caused so
great and so general a sensation, not so much amongst the
Gypsies, that peculiar people for whom it was intended, as
amongst the Spaniards themselves, who, though they look upon the
Roma with some degree of contempt as a low and thievish race of
outcasts, nevertheless take a strange interest in all that
concerns them, it having been from time immemorial their
practice, more especially of the dissolute young nobility, to
cultivate the acquaintance of the Gitanos, as they are popularly
called, probably attracted by the wild wit of the latter and the
lascivious dances of the females.&nbsp; The apparation,
therefore, of the Gospel of St Luke at Madrid in the peculiar
jargon of these people, was hailed as a strange novelty and
almost as a wonder, and I believe was particularly instrumental
in bruiting the name of the Bible Society far and wide through
Spain, and in creating a feeling far from inimical towards it and
its proceedings.&rdquo; <a name="citation222a"></a><a
href="#footnote222a" class="citation">[222a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little volume appears to have sold freely among the
gypsies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many of the men,&rdquo; Borrow says, <a
name="citation222b"></a><a href="#footnote222b"
class="citation">[222b]</a> &ldquo;understood it, and prized it
highly, induced of course more by the language than the doctrine;
the women were particularly anxious to obtain copies, though
unable to read; but each wished to have one in her pocket,
especially when engaged in thieving expeditions, for they all
looked upon it in the light of a charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All endeavours to get the prohibition against the sale of the
New Testament removed proved unavailing.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
great strength lay in the support he received from the British
Minister, and, in all probability, this prevented his expulsion
from Spain, which alone would have satisfied his enemies.&nbsp;
At the request of Sir George Villiers, he drew up an account of
the Bible Society and an exposition of its views, telling Count
Ofalia, among other things, that &ldquo;the mightiest of earthly
monarchs, the late Alexander of Russia, was so convinced of the
single-mindedness and integrity of the British and Foreign Bible
Society, that he promoted their efforts within his own dominions
to the utmost of his ability.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to the
condition of Spain, which was &ldquo;overspread with the thickest
gloom of heathenish ignorance, beneath which the fiends and
demons of the abyss seem to be holding their ghastly
revels.&rdquo;&nbsp; He described it as &ldquo;a country in which
all sense of right and wrong is forgotten . . . where the name of
Jesus is scarcely ever mentioned but in blasphemy, and His
precepts [are] almost utterly unknown . . . [where] the few who
are enlightened are too much occupied in the pursuit of lucre,
ambition, or ungodly revenge to entertain a desire or thought of
bettering the moral state of their countrymen.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
report, in which Borrow confesses that he &ldquo;made no attempts
to flatter and cajole,&rdquo; must have caused the British
Minister some diplomatic embarrassment when he read it; but it
seems to have been presented, although, as is scarcely
surprising, it appears to have been ineffectual in causing to be
removed the ban against which it was written as a protest.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was in a peculiarly unpleasant
position.&nbsp; On the one hand there was the British Minister
using all his influence to get the prohibition rescinded; on the
other hand were six bishops, including the primate, then resident
in Madrid, and the greater part of the clergy.&nbsp; Count Ofalia
applied for a copy of the Gipsy St Luke, and, seeing in this an
opening for a personal appeal, Borrow determined to present the
volume, specially and handsomely bound, in person, probably the
last thing that Count Ofalia expected or desired.&nbsp; The
interview produced nothing beyond the conviction in
Borrow&rsquo;s mind that Spain was ruled by a man who possessed
the soul of a mouse.&nbsp; Borrow had been received &ldquo;with
great affability,&rdquo; thanked for his present, urged to be
patient and peaceable, assured of the enmity of the clergy, and
promised that an endeavour should be made to devise some plan
that would be satisfactory to him.&nbsp; The two then
&ldquo;parted in kindness,&rdquo; and as he walked away from the
palace, Borrow wondered &ldquo;by what strange chance this poor
man had become Prime Minister of a country like Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reporting progress to the Bible Society on 17th March
Borrow, after assuring Mr Brandram that he had &ldquo;brought
every engine into play which it was in my power to
command,&rdquo; asked for instructions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I wait
a little time longer in Madrid,&rdquo; he enquired; &ldquo;or
shall I proceed at once on a journey to Andalusia and other
places?&nbsp; I am in strength, health and spirits, thanks be to
the Lord! and am at all times ready to devote myself, body and
mind, to His cause.&rdquo; <a name="citation224a"></a><a
href="#footnote224a" class="citation">[224a]</a>&nbsp; The
decision of the Committee was that he should remain at
Madrid.</p>
<p>During the time that Borrow had been preparing his Dep&ocirc;t
in Madrid, Lieutenant Graydon had been feverishly active in the
South.&nbsp; On 19th April Borrow wrote to Mr
Brandram:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir George Villiers has vowed to protect me
and has stated so publicly . . . He has gone so far as to state
to Ofalia and [Don Ramon de] Gamboa [the Civil Governor], that
provided I be allowed to pursue my plans without interruption, he
will be my bail (<i>fiador</i>) and answerable for everything I
do, as he does me the honor to say that he knows me, and can
confide in <i>my</i> discretion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same letter he begs the Society to be cautious and
offer no encouragement to any disposed &ldquo;&lsquo;to run the
muck&rsquo; (<i>sic</i>) (it is Sir George&rsquo;s expression)
against the religious and political <i>institutions</i> of
Spain&rdquo;; but &ldquo;the delicacy of the situation does not
appear to have been thoroughly understood at the time even by the
Committee at home.&rdquo; <a name="citation224b"></a><a
href="#footnote224b" class="citation">[224b]</a>&nbsp; They saw
the astonishing success of Graydon in distributing the Scripture,
and became infused with his enthusiasm, oblivious to the fact
that the greater the enthusiasm the greater the possibilities of
indiscretion.&nbsp; On the other hand Graydon himself saw only
the glory of the Gospel.&nbsp; If he were indiscreet, it was
because he was blinded by the success that attended his efforts,
and he failed to see the clouds that were gathering. <a
name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a>&nbsp; Borrow saw the danger of
Graydon&rsquo;s reckless evangelism, and although he himself had
few good words for the pope and priestcraft, he recognised that a
discreet veiling of his opinions was best calculated to further
the ends he had in view.</p>
<p>About this period Borrow became greatly incensed at the action
of the Rev. W. H. Rule of Gibraltar in consigning to his care an
ex-priest, Don Pascual Mann, who, it was alleged, had been
persuaded to secede from Rome &ldquo;by certain promises and
hopes held out&rdquo; to him.&nbsp; He had accordingly left his
benefice and gone to Gibraltar to receive instruction at the
hands of Mr Rule.&nbsp; On his return to Valencia his salary was
naturally sequestrated, and he was reduced to want.&nbsp; When he
arrived at Madrid it was with a letter (12th April) from Mr Rule
to Borrow, in which it was stated that Mann was sent that he
might &ldquo;endeavour to circulate the Holy Scriptures,
Religious Tracts and books, and if possible prepare the minds of
some with a view to the future establishment of a Mission in
Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had commiserated with the unfortunate Mann, even to the
extent of sending him 500 <i>reals</i> out of his own pocket; but
on hearing that he was on his way to Madrid to engage in
missionary work, he immediately wrote a letter of protest to Mr
Brandram.&nbsp; He was angry at Mr Rule&rsquo;s conduct in
saddling him with Mann, and that without any preliminary
correspondence.&nbsp; He had entertained Mr Rule when in Madrid,
had conversed with him about the unfortunate ex-priest; but there
had never been any mention of his being sent to Madrid.&nbsp; Mr
Rule, on the other hand, thought it had been arranged that Mann
should be sent to Borrow.&nbsp; The whole affair appears to have
arisen out of a misunderstanding.&nbsp; There was considerable
danger to Borrow in Mann&rsquo;s presence in the capital; but it
was not the thought of the danger that incensed him so much as
what he conceived to be Mr Rule&rsquo;s unwarrantable conduct,
and his own deeply-rooted objection to working with anyone
else.&nbsp; Mr Brandram repudiated the suggestion that assistance
had been promised Mann from London (although he authorised Borrow
to give him ten pounds in his, Brandram&rsquo;s, name), and gave
as an excuse for what Borrow described as the desertion of the
ex-priest by those who were responsible for his conversion, that
&ldquo;the man had returned of his own accord to Rome,&rdquo;
Graydon vouching for the accuracy of the statement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mann stated that he was persuaded to secede
by promises made by Graydon and Rule, and induced to sign a
document purporting to be a separation from the Roman
Church.&nbsp; He further stated that he was abandoned because he
refused to preach publicly against the Chapter of Valencia, which
in all probability would have resulted in his imprisonment.&nbsp;
Whatever the truth, there appears to have been some embarrassment
among those responsible for bringing in the lost sheep as to what
should be done with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope that Mann&rsquo;s
history will be a warning to many of our friends,&rdquo; Borrow
wrote to Mr Rule and quoted the passage in his letter to Mr
Brandram, <a name="citation226"></a><a href="#footnote226"
class="citation">[226]</a> &ldquo;and tend to a certain extent to
sober down the desire for doing what is called at home <i>smart
things</i>, many of which terminate in a manner very different
from the original expectations of the parties
concerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Brandram thought that Borrow was a
little hard upon Graydon, and that he had not received
&ldquo;with the due <i>grano salis</i> the statements of the
unfortunate M.&rdquo;&nbsp; He intimated, nevertheless, that the
Committee had no opening for Mann&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>That Borrow was justified in his anger is shown by the fact
that, as he had foreseen, he reaped all the odium of Mann&rsquo;s
conversion.&nbsp; The Bishop of Cordoba in Council branded him as
&ldquo;a dangerous, pestilent person, who under the pretence of
selling the Scriptures went about making converts, and moreover
employed subordinates for the purpose of deluding weak and silly
people into separation from the Mother Church.&rdquo; <a
name="citation227a"></a><a href="#footnote227a"
class="citation">[227a]</a></p>
<p>Although Borrow was angry about the Mann episode, he did not
allow his personal feelings to prevent him from ministering to
the needs of the poor ex-priest &ldquo;as far as prudence will
allow,&rdquo; when he fell ill.&nbsp; He even went the length of
writing to Mr Rule, being wishful &ldquo;not to offend
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; None the less he felt that he had not been well
treated.&nbsp; To Mr Brandram he wrote reminding him &ldquo;that
all the difficulty and danger connected with what has been
accomplished in Spain have fallen to my share, I having been
labouring on the flinty rock and sierra, and not in smiling
meadows refreshed by sea breezes.&rdquo; <a
name="citation227b"></a><a href="#footnote227b"
class="citation">[227b]</a></p>
<p>On 14th July 1838 Borrow made the last reference to the
ex-priest in a letter to Mr Brandram: &ldquo;The unfortunate M.
is dying of a galloping consumption, brought on by distress of
mind.&nbsp; All the medicine in the world would not accomplish
his cure.&rdquo; <a name="citation227c"></a><a
href="#footnote227c" class="citation">[227c]</a></p>
<p>The watchful eye of the law was still on Borrow, and fearful
lest his stock of Bibles, of which 500 had arrived from
Barcelona, and the Gypsy and Basque editions of St Luke should be
seized, he hired a room where he stored the bulk of the
books.&nbsp; He now advertised the two editions of St Luke, with
the result that on 16th April a party of <i>Alguazils</i> entered
the shop and took possession of twenty-five copies of the Romany
Gospel of St Luke.</p>
<p>On the publication of the Gypsy St Luke, a fresh campaign had
been opened against Borrow, and accusations of sorcery were made
and fears expressed as to the results of the publication of the
book.&nbsp; Application was made by the priestly party to the
Civil Governor, with the result that all the copies at the
<i>Despacho</i> of the Basque and Gitano versions of St Luke had
been seized.&nbsp; Borrow states that the <i>Alguazils</i>
&ldquo;divided the copies of the gypsy volume among themselves,
selling subsequently the greater number at a large price, the
book being in the greatest demand.&rdquo; <a
name="citation228a"></a><a href="#footnote228a"
class="citation">[228a]</a>&nbsp; Thus the very officials
responsible for the seizure and suppression of the Bible
Society&rsquo;s books in Spain became &ldquo;unintentionally
agents of an heretical society.&rdquo; <a
name="citation228b"></a><a href="#footnote228b"
class="citation">[228b]</a></p>
<p>Disappointed at the smallness of the spoil, the authorities
strove by artifice to discover if Borrow still had copies of the
books in his possession.&nbsp; To this end they sent to the
<i>Despacho</i> spies, who offered high prices for copies of the
Gitano St Luke, in which their interest seemed specially to
centre, to the exclusion of the Basque version.&nbsp; To these
enquiries the same answer was returned, that at present no
further books would be sold at the <i>Despacho</i>.</p>
<p>As evidence of the high opinion formed of the Romany version
of St Luke, the following story told by Borrow is
amusing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shortly before my departure a royal edict
was published, authorising all public libraries to provide
themselves with copies of the said works [the Basque and Gypsy St
Lukes] on account of their philological merit; whereupon on
application being made to the Office [of the Civil Governor,
where the books were supposed to be stored], it was discovered
that the copies of the Gospel in Basque were safe and
forthcoming, whilst every one of the sequestered copies of the
Gitano Gospel had been plundered by hands unknown [to the
authorities].&nbsp; The consequence was that I was myself applied
to by the agents of the public libraries of Valencia and other
places, who paid me the price of the copies which they received,
assuring me at the same time that they were authorised to
purchase them at whatever price which might be demanded.&rdquo;
<a name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s enemies acknowledged that the Gitano St Luke
was a philological curiosity; but that it was impossible to allow
it to pass into circulation without notes.&nbsp; How great a
philological curiosity it actually was, is shown by the fact that
the ecclesiastical authorities were unable to find anywhere a
person, in whom they had confidence, capable of pronouncing upon
it, consequently they could only condemn it on two counts of
omission; firstly the notes, secondly the imprint of the printer
from the title-page.</p>
<p>The Basque version was by no means so popular; for one thing,
&ldquo;It can scarcely be said to have been published,&rdquo;
Borrow wrote, &ldquo;it having been prohibited, and copies of it
seized on the second day of its appearance.&rdquo; <a
name="citation229b"></a><a href="#footnote229b"
class="citation">[229b]</a>&nbsp; Several orders were received
from San Sebastian and other towns where Basque predominates,
which could not be supplied on account of the prohibition.</p>
<p>The official remonstrance from Sir George Villiers to Count
Ofalia in respect of the seizure of the Gypsy and Basque Gospels
is of great interest as showing, not only the British
Minister&rsquo;s attitude towards Borrow, but how, and with what
wrath, Borrow &ldquo;desisted from his meritorious
task.&rdquo;&nbsp; The communication runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Madrid</span>, 24<i>th</i> <i>April</i> 1838.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>It is my duty to request the attention of Your Excellency to
an act of injustice committed against a British subject by the
Civil Authorities of Madrid.</p>
<p>It appears that on the 16th inst., two officers of Police were
sent by the Civil Governor to a Shop, No. 25 Calle del Principe
occupied by Mr Borrow, where they seized and carried away 25
Copies of the Gospel of St Luke in the Gitano language, being the
entire number exposed there for sale.</p>
<p>Mr Borrow is an agent of the British Bible Society, who has
for some time past been in Spain, and in the year 1836 obtained
permission from the Government of Her Catholic Majesty to print,
at the expense of the Society, Padre Scio&rsquo;s translation of
the New Testament.&nbsp; He subsequently sold the work at a
moderate price and had no reason to believe that in so doing he
infringed any law of Spain or exposed himself to the
animadversion of the Authorities, otherwise, from my knowledge of
Mr Borrow&rsquo;s character, I feel justified in assuring Your
Excellency that he would at once, although with regret, have
desisted from his meritorious task of propagating the
Gospel.&nbsp; Some months ago, however, the late Civil Governor
of Madrid, after having sent for and examined a copy of the work,
thought proper to direct that its further sale should be
suspended, which order was instantly complied with.</p>
<p>Mr Borrow is a man of great learning and research and master
of many languages, and having translated the Gospel of St Luke
into the Gitano, he presented a copy of it to Don Ramon Gamboa,
the late Civil Governor, and announced his intention to advertise
it for sale, to which no objection was made.</p>
<p>Since that time neither Mr Borrow nor the persons employed by
him received any communication from the present Civil Governor
forbidding the sale of this work until it was seized in the
manner I have above described to Your Excellency.</p>
<p>I feel convinced that the mere statement of these facts
without any commentary on my part will be sufficient to induce
your Excellency to take steps for the indemnification of Mr
Borrow, who is not only a very respectable British subject but
the Agent of one of the most truly benevolent and philanthropic
Societies in the world.</p>
<p>I have, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
MAY 1&ndash;13, 1838</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of 30th April,
whilst at breakfast, Borrow, according to his own account,
received a visit from a man who announced that he was &ldquo;A
Police Agent.&rdquo;&nbsp; He came from the Civil Governor, who
was perfectly aware that he, Borrow, was continuing in secret to
dispose of the &ldquo;evil books&rdquo; that he had been
forbidden to sell.&nbsp; The man began poking round among the
books and papers that were lying about, with the result that
Borrow led his visitor by the arm down the three flights of
stairs into the street, &ldquo;looking him steadfastly in the
face the whole time,&rdquo; and subsequently sending down by his
landlady the official&rsquo;s sombrero, which, in the
unexpectedness of his departure, he had left behind him.</p>
<p>The official report of Pedro Martin de Eugenio, the police
agent in question, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span

the Copies Entitled the Gospel of St Luke, in the Shop Princes
Street No. 25, belonging to Mr George Borrow, but not finding him
there; I went to his lodgings, which are in St James Street, No.
16, on the third floor and presenting the said order to Him He
read it, and with an angry look threw it on the ground saying,
that He had nothing to do with the Civil Governor, that He was
authorised by His Ambassador to sell the Work in question, and
that an English Stable Boy, is more than any Spanish Civil
Governor, and that I had forcibly entered his house, to which I
replied that I only went there to communicate the order to Him,
as proprietor as he was of the said Shop, and to seize the Copies
in it in virtue of that Order, and He answered I might do as I
liked, that He should go to the House of His Ambassador, and that
I should be responsible for the consequences; to which I replied
that He had personally insulted the Civil Governor and all Spain,
to which He answered in the same terms, holding the same language
as above stated.</p>

required.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Borrow felt that the fellow had been sent to entrap him into
some utterance that should justify his arrest.&nbsp; In any case
a warrant was issued that same morning.&nbsp; The news caused
Borrow no alarm; for one thing he was indifferent to danger, for
another he was desirous of studying the robber language of Spain,
and had already, according to his own statement, <a
name="citation232b"></a><a href="#footnote232b"
class="citation">[232b]</a> made an unsuccessful effort to obtain
admission to the city prison.</p>
<p>The official account of the interview between Borrow and the
&ldquo;Police Agent&rdquo; is given in the following letter from
the Civil Governor to Sir George Villiers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To the British Minister,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>,
30<i>th</i> <i>April</i> 1838.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>The Vicar of the Diocese having, on the 16th and 26th Instant,
officially represented to me, that neither the publication nor
the sale of the Gospel of St Luke translated into the romain, or
Gitano Dialect ought to be permitted, until such time as the
translation had been examined and approved by the competent
Ecclesiastical Authority, in conformity with the Canonical and
Civil regulations existing on the matter, I gave an order to a
dependent of this civil administration, to present himself in the
house of Mr George Borrow, a British Subject, charged by the
London Bible Society with the publication of this work, and to
seize all the Copies of it.&nbsp; In execution of this order my
Warrant was yesterday morning <a name="citation233"></a><a
href="#footnote233" class="citation">[233]</a> presented to the
said Mr George Borrow; who, so far from obeying it, broke out in
insults most offensive to my authority, threw the order on the
ground with angry gestures, and grossly abused the bearer of it,
and said that he had nothing to do with the Civil Governor.&nbsp;
The detailed report in writing which has been made to me of this
disageeeable occurrence could not but deeply affect me, being a
question of a British Subject, to whom the Government of Her
Catholic Majesty has always afforded the same protection as to
its own.&nbsp; As Executor of the Law it is my duty to cause its
decrees to be inviolably observed; and you will well understand,
that both the Canonical as the Civil Laws now existing, in this
kingdom, relative to writings and works published upon Dogmas,
Morals, and holy and religious matters, are the same without
distinction for the Subjects of all Countries residing in
Spain.&nbsp; No one can be permitted to violate them with
impunity, without detriment to the Laws themselves, to the Royal
Authority and to the Evangelical Moral which is highly interested
in preventing the propagation of doctrines which may be
erroneous, and that the purity of the sublime maxims of our
divine Faith should remain intact.</p>
<p>In conformity with these undeniable principles, which are in
the Laws of all civilised nations, you must acknowledge that the
offensive conduct of Mr George Borrow, and his disobedience to a
legitimate Authority sufficiently authorised the proceeding to
his arrest . . .</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Police Agent&rdquo; seems to have boasted that
within twenty-four hours Borrow would be in prison; Borrow, on
the other hand, determined to prove the &ldquo;Police
Agent&rdquo; wrong.&nbsp; He therefore spent the rest of the day
and the following night at a caf&eacute;. <a
name="citation234a"></a><a href="#footnote234a"
class="citation">[234a]</a>&nbsp; In the evening he received a
visit from Maria Diaz, <a name="citation234b"></a><a
href="#footnote234b" class="citation">[234b]</a> his landlady and
also his strong adherent and friend, whom he had informed of his
whereabouts.&nbsp; From her he learned that his lodgings had been
searched and that the <i>alguazils</i>, who bore a warrant for
his arrest, were much disappointed at not finding him.</p>
<p>The next morning, 1st May, at the request of Sir George
Villiers, Borrow called at the Embassy and narrated every
circumstance of the affair, with the result that he was offered
the hospitality of the Embassy, which he declined.&nbsp; Whilst
in conversation with Mr Sothern, Sir George Villiers&rsquo;
private secretary, Borrow&rsquo;s Basque servant Francisco rushed
in with the news that the <i>alguazils</i> were again at his
rooms searching among his papers, whereat Borrow at once left the
Embassy, determined to return to his lodgings.&nbsp; Immediately
afterwards he was arrested, <a name="citation234c"></a><a
href="#footnote234c" class="citation">[234c]</a> within sight of
the doors of the Embassy, and conducted to the office of the
Civil Governor.&nbsp; Francisco in the meantime, acting on his
master&rsquo;s instructions, conveyed to him in Basque that the
<i>alguazils</i> might not understand, proceeded immediately to
the British Embassy and informed Sir George Villiers of what had
just taken place, with such eloquence and feeling that Mr Sothern
afterwards remarked to Borrow, &ldquo;That Basque of yours is a
noble fellow,&rdquo; and asked to be given the refusal of his
services should Borrow ever decide to part with him.&nbsp; With
his dependents Borrow was always extremely popular, even in
Spain, where, according to Mr Sothern, a man&rsquo;s servant
seemed to be his worst enemy.</p>
<p>Borrow submitted quietly to his arrest and was first taken to
the office of the Civil Governor (<i>Gefatura Politica</i>), and
subsequently to the Carcel de la Corte, by two Salvaguardias,
&ldquo;like a common malefactor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he was
assigned a chamber that was &ldquo;large and lofty, but totally
destitute of every species of furniture with the exception of a
huge wooden pitcher, intended to hold my daily allowance of
water.&rdquo; <a name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a>&nbsp; For this special accommodation
Borrow was to pay, otherwise he would have been herded with the
common criminals, who existed in a state of foulness and
misery.&nbsp; Acting on the advice of the <i>Alcayde</i>, Borrow
despatched a note to Maria Diaz, with the result that when Mr
Sothern arrived, he found the prisoner not only surrounded by his
friends and furniture, but enjoying a comfortable meal, whereat
he laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Borrow learned that, immediately on hearing what had taken
place, Sir George Villiers had despatched Mr Sothern to interview
Se&ntilde;or Entrena, the Civil Governor, who rudely referred him
to his secretary, and refused to hold any communication with the
British Legation save in writing.&nbsp; Nothing further could be
done that night, and on hearing that Borrow was determined to
remain in durance, even if offered his liberty, now that he had
been illegally placed there, Mr Sothern commended his
resolution.&nbsp; The Government had put itself grievously in the
wrong, and Sir George, who had already sent a note to Count
Ofalia demanding redress, seemed desirous of making it as
difficult for them as possible, now that they had perpetrated
this wanton outrage on a British subject.&nbsp; He determined to
make it a national affair.</p>
<p>It is by no means certain that Borrow was anxious to leave the
<i>Carcel de la Corte</i>, even with the apologies of Spain in
his pocket.&nbsp; The prison afforded him unique opportunities
for the study of criminal vagabonds.&nbsp; An entirely new phase
of life presented itself to him, and, but for this arrest and his
subsequent decision to involve the authorities in difficulties,
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> would have lacked some of its most
picturesque pages.&nbsp; It would have been strange if he had not
encountered some old friend or acquaintance in the prison of the
Spanish capital.&nbsp; At the <i>Carcel de la Corte</i> he found
the notorious and immense Gitana, Aurora, who had fallen into the
hands of the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> for defrauding a rather foolish
widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many people came to see me,&rdquo; Borrow wrote
to his mother, &ldquo;amongst others, General Quiroga, the
Military Governor, who assured me that all he possessed was at my
service.&nbsp; The Gypsies likewise came, but were refused
admittance.&rdquo;&nbsp; His dinner was taken to him from an inn,
and Sir George Villiers sent his butler each day to make
enquiries.&nbsp; There was, however, one very unpleasant feature
of his prison life, the verminous condition of the whole
building.&nbsp; In spite of having fresh linen taken to him each
day, he suffered very much from what the polished Spaniard
prefers to call <i>miseria</i>.</p>
<p>Sir George Villiers took active and immediate steps, not only
to secure Borrow&rsquo;s release, but to obtain an unqualified
apology.&nbsp; Referring to the letter he had received from the
Civil Governor (30th April), he expressed himself as convinced
that &ldquo;a gentleman of Borrow&rsquo;s character and education
was incapable of the conduct alleged,&rdquo; and had accordingly
requested Mr Sothern to enquire into the matter and then to call
upon the Civil Governor to explain in what manner he had been
misinformed.&nbsp; As the Civil Governor refused to receive Mr
Sothern, Sir George adds that he need trouble him no further, as
the affair had been placed before Her Catholic Majesty&rsquo;s
Government; but during his five years of office at the Court of
Madrid, he proceeded, &ldquo;no circumstance has occurred likely
to be more prejudicial to the relations between the two Countries
than the insult and imprisonment to which a respectable
Englishman has now been subjected upon the unsupported evidence
of a Police Officer,&rdquo; acting under the orders of the Civil
Governor.</p>
<p>On 3rd May Sir George Villiers wrote again to Count Ofalia,
reminding him that he had not received the letter from him that
he had expected.&nbsp; In the course of a lengthy recapitulation
of the occurrences of the past ten days, Sir George reminded
Count Ofalia that, as a result of their interview on 30th April
about the ill-usage of Borrow, the Count had written on 1st May
to him a private letter stating that measures had been taken to
release Borrow on <i>parole</i>, he to appear when necessary, and
that if Sir George would abstain from making a written
remonstrance, Count Ofalia would see that both he and Borrow
received the ample satisfaction to which they were
entitled.&nbsp; Borrow had been taken by two Guards &ldquo;like a
Malefactor, to the Common Prison, where he would have been
confined with Criminals of every description if he had not had
money to pay for a Cell to Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The British
Minister complained that every step that he had taken for
Borrow&rsquo;s protection was followed by fresh insult, and he
further intimated that Borrow refused to leave the prison until
his character had been publicly cleared.</p>
<p>The Spanish Government now found itself in a quandary.&nbsp;
The British Minister was pressing for satisfaction, and he was
too powerful and too important to the needs of Spain to be
offended.&nbsp; The prisoner himself refused to be liberated,
because he had been illegally arrested, inasmuch as he, a
foreigner, had been committed to prison without first being
conducted before the Captain-General of Madrid, as the law
provided.&nbsp; Furthermore, Borrow advised the authorities that
if they chose to eject him from the prison he would resist with
all his bodily strength.&nbsp; In this determination he was
confirmed by the British Minister.</p>
<p>A Cabinet Council was held, at which Se&ntilde;or Entrena was
present.&nbsp; The Premier explained the serious situation in
which the ministry found itself, owing to the attitude assumed by
the British Minister, and he remarked that the Civil Governor
must respect the privileges of foreigners.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;or
Entrena suggested that he should be relieved of his duties; but
the majority of the Cabinet seems to have been favourable to
him.&nbsp; The <i>Affaire Borrow</i> is said to have come up for
debate even during a secret session of the Chamber.</p>
<p>When Count Ofalia had called at the British Embassy (4th May)
he was informed by Sir George Villiers that the affair had passed
beyond the radius of a subordinate authority of the Government,
and that he &ldquo;considered that great want of respect had been
shown to me, as Her Majesty&rsquo;s Minister, and that an
unjustifiable outrage had been committed upon a British
Subject,&rdquo; <a name="citation238a"></a><a
href="#footnote238a" class="citation">[238a]</a> and that the
least reparation that he was disposed to accept was a written
declaration that an injustice had been done, and the dismissal of
the Police Officer. <a name="citation238b"></a><a
href="#footnote238b" class="citation">[238b]</a></p>
<p>The value of a British subject&rsquo;s freedom was brought
home to the Spanish Government with astonishing swiftness and
decision.&nbsp; The Civil Governor wrote to Sir George Villiers
(3rd May), apparently at the instance of the distraught premier,
discoursing sagely upon the Civil and Canon Laws of Spain, and
adding that the 25 copies of the Gitano St Luke were seized,
&ldquo;not as being confiscated, but as a deposit to be restored
in due time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He concluded by hoping that he had
convinced the British Minister of his good faith.</p>
<p>In his reply, Sir George considered that the Civil Governor
had been led to view the matter in a light that would not
&ldquo;bear the test of impartial examination.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
result of this interchange of letters was twofold.&nbsp; Sir
George dropped the correspondence with &ldquo;that Functionary
[who] displays so complete a disregard for fact,&rdquo; <a
name="citation239a"></a><a href="#footnote239a"
class="citation">[239a]</a> and as Count Ofalia evaded the real
question at issue, holding out &ldquo;slender hopes of the matter
ending in the reparation which I considered to be peremptorily
called for,&rdquo; <a name="citation239b"></a><a
href="#footnote239b" class="citation">[239b]</a> he advised
Borrow to claim protection from the Captain-General, the only
authority competent to exercise any jurisdiction over him.&nbsp;
The Captain-General Quiroga, jealous of his authority, entered
warmly into the dispute and ordered the Civil Governor to hand
over the case to him.&nbsp; There was now a danger of the
<i>Affaire Borrow</i> being made a party question, in which case
it would have been extremely difficult to settle.</p>
<p>The intervention of the Captain-General rendered all the more
obvious the illegality of the Civil Governor&rsquo;s action, and
increased the embarrassment of Count Ofalia, who called on Sir
George to ask him to have Borrow&rsquo;s memorial to the
Captain-General withdrawn.&nbsp; He refused, and said the only
way now to finish the affair was that &ldquo;His Excellency
should in an official Note declare to me that Mr Borrow left the
prison, where he had been improperly placed, with unstained
honour,&mdash;that the Police Agent, upon whose testimony he had
been arrested, should be dismissed,&mdash;that all expenses
imposed upon Mr Borrow by his detention should be repaid him by
the Government,&mdash;that Mr Borrow&rsquo;s not having availed
himself of the &lsquo;Fuero Militar&rsquo; should not be
converted into a precedent, or in any way be considered to
prejudice that important right, and that Count Ofalia should add
with reference to maintaining the friendly relations between
Great Britain and Spain, that he hoped I would accept this
satisfaction as sufficient.&rdquo; <a name="citation240a"></a><a
href="#footnote240a" class="citation">[240a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow states that Sir George Villiers went to the length of
informing Count Ofalia that unless full satisfaction were
accorded Borrow, he would demand his passports and instruct the
commanders of the British war vessels to desist from furnishing
further assistance to Spain. <a name="citation240b"></a><a
href="#footnote240b" class="citation">[240b]</a>&nbsp; There is,
however, no record of this in the official papers sent by Sir
George to the Foreign Office.&nbsp; What actually occurred was
that, on 8th May, the British Minister, determined to brook no
further delay, wrote a grave official remonstrance, in which he
stated that, &ldquo;if the desire had existed to bring it to a
close,&rdquo; the case of Borrow could have been settled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Having up to the present moment,&rdquo; he proceeds,
&ldquo;trusted that in Your Excellency&rsquo;s hands, this affair
would be treated with all that consideration required by its
nature and the consequences that may follow upon it . . . I have
forborne from denouncing the whole extent of the illegality which
has marked the proceedings of the case&rdquo; (viz., the Civil
Governor&rsquo;s having usurped the right of the Captain-General
of the Province in causing Borrow&rsquo;s arrest).&nbsp; In
conclusion, Sir George states that he considers the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;case of most pressing importance, for it
may compromise the relations now existing between Great Britain
and Spain.&nbsp; It is one that requires a complete satisfaction,
for the honor of England and the future position of Englishmen in
the Country are concerned; and the satisfaction, in order to be
complete, required to be promptly given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This disagreeable business,&rdquo; Sir George writes in
another of his despatches, &ldquo;is rendered yet more so by the
impossibility of defending with success all Mr Borrow&rsquo;s
proceedings . . .&nbsp; His imprudent zeal likewise in announcing
publicly that the Bible Society had a dep&ocirc;t of Bibles in
Madrid, and that he was the Agent for their sale, irritated the
Ecclesiastical Authorities, whose attention has of late been
called to the proceedings of a Mr Graydon,&mdash;another agent of
the Bible Society, who has created great excitement at Malaga
(and I believe in other places) by publishing in the Newspapers
that the Catholic Religion was not the religion of God, and that
he had been sent from England to convert Spaniards to
Protestantism.&nbsp; I have upon more than one occasion cautioned
Mr Graydon, but in vain, to be more prudent.&nbsp; The Methodist
Society of England is likewise endeavouring to establish a School
at Cadiz, and by that means to make conversions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under all these circumstances it is not perhaps
surprising that the Archbishop of Toledo and the Heads of the
Church should be alarmed that an attempt at Protestant
Propagandism is about to be made, or that the Government should
wish to avert the evils of religious schism in addition to all
those which already weigh upon the Country; and to these
different causes it must, in some degree, be attributed that Mr
Borrow has been an object of suspicion and treated with such
extreme rigor.&nbsp; Still, however, they do not justify the
course pursued by the Civil Governor towards him, or by the
Government towards myself, and I trust Your Lordship will
consider that in the steps I have taken upon the matter, I have
done no more than what the National honor, and the security of
Englishmen in this Country, rendered obligatory upon me.&rdquo;
<a name="citation241a"></a><a href="#footnote241a"
class="citation">[241a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst Borrow was in the <i>Carcel de la Corte</i>, a grave
complication had arisen in connection with the misguided
Lieutenant Graydon.&nbsp; Borrow gives a strikingly dramatic
account <a name="citation241b"></a><a href="#footnote241b"
class="citation">[241b]</a> of Count Ofalia&rsquo;s call at the
British Embassy.&nbsp; He is represented as arriving with a copy
of one of Graydon&rsquo;s bills, which he threw down upon a table
calling upon Sir George Villiers to read it and, as a gentleman
and the representative of a great and enlightened nation, tell
him if he could any longer defend Borrow and say that he had been
ill or unfairly treated.&nbsp; According to the Foreign Office
documents, Count Ofalia <i>wrote</i> to Sir George Villiers on
5th May, <i>enclosing</i> a copy of an advertisement inserted by
Lieutenant Graydon in the <i>Boletin Oficial de Malaga</i>,
which, translated, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Individual in question most earnestly
calls the greatest attention of each member of the great Spanish
Family to this <i>divine</i> Book, in order that <i>through
it</i> he may learn the chief cause, if not the <i>sole one</i>,
of all his terrible afflictions and of his <i>only</i> remedy, as
it is so clearly manifested in the Holy Scripture . . .&nbsp; A
detestable system of superstition and fanaticism, <i>only greedy
for money</i>, and not so either of the temporal or eternal
felicity of man, has prevailed in Spain (as also in other
Nations) during several Centuries, by the <i>absolute</i>
exclusion of the true knowledge of the Great God and last Judge
of Mankind: and thus it has been plunged into the most frightful
calamities.&nbsp; There was a time in which precisely the same
was read in the then <i>very little</i> Kingdom of England, but
at length Her Sons recognising their imperative <i>Duty</i>
towards God and their Neighbour, as also their unquestionable
rights, and that since the world exists it has never been
possible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles,
they destroyed the system and at the price of their blood chose
the Bible.&nbsp; Oh that the unprejudiced and enlightened
inhabitants not only of Malaga and of so many other Cities, but
of all Spain, would follow so good an example.&rdquo; <a
name="citation242a"></a><a href="#footnote242a"
class="citation">[242a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of Graydon&rsquo;s advertisement was that
&ldquo;the people flocked in crowds to purchase it [the Bible],
so much so that 200 copies, all that were in Mr Graydon&rsquo;s
possession at the time, were sold in the course of the day.&nbsp;
The Bishop sent the Fiscal to stop the sale of the work, but
before the necessary measures were taken they were all disposed
of.&rdquo; <a name="citation242b"></a><a href="#footnote242b"
class="citation">[242b]</a>&nbsp; In consequence Graydon
&ldquo;was detained and under my [the Consul&rsquo;s]
responsibility allowed to remain at large.&rdquo; <a
name="citation243a"></a><a href="#footnote243a"
class="citation">[243a]</a>&nbsp; A jury of nine all pronounced
the article to contain &ldquo;matter subject to legal
process&rdquo; <a name="citation243b"></a><a href="#footnote243b"
class="citation">[243b]</a> but a second jury of twelve at the
subsequent public trial &ldquo;unanimously absolved&rdquo;
Graydon.</p>
<p>Sir George Villiers acknowledged the letter from Count Ofalia
(9th May) saying that he had written to Graydon warning him to be
more cautious in future.&nbsp; He stated that from personal
knowledge he could vouch for the purity of Lieutenant
Graydon&rsquo;s intentions; but he regretted that he should have
announced his object in so imprudent a manner as to give offence
to the ministers of the Catholic religion of Spain.&nbsp; In a
despatch to Lord Palmerston he states that he has not thought it
in the interests of the Bible Society to defend this conduct of
Graydon, &ldquo;whose zeal appears so little tempered by
discretion,&rdquo; <a name="citation243c"></a><a
href="#footnote243c" class="citation">[243c]</a> as he had
written to Count Ofalia.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had I done so,&rdquo; he
proceeds, &ldquo;and thereby tended to confirm some of the idle
reports that are current, that England had a national object to
serve in the propagation of Protestantism in Spain, it is not
improbable that a legislative Enactment might have been
introduced by some Member of the Cortes, which would be offensive
to England, and render it yet more difficult than it is the task
the Bible Society seems desirous to undertake in this
Country.&rdquo; <a name="citation243d"></a><a
href="#footnote243d" class="citation">[243d]</a>&nbsp; Sir George
concludes by saying that he gave to &ldquo;these Agents the best
advice and assistance in my power, but if by their acts they
infringe the laws of the Country,&rdquo; it will be impossible to
defend them.</p>
<p>Sir George thought so seriously of the <i>Affaire Borrow</i>,
as endangering the future liberty of Englishmen in Spain, that he
went so far as to send a message to the Queen Regent, &ldquo;by a
means which I always have at my disposal,&rdquo; <a
name="citation244a"></a><a href="#footnote244a"
class="citation">[244a]</a> in which he told her that he thought
the affair &ldquo;might end in a manner most injurious to the
continuance of friendly relations between the two
Countries.&rdquo; <a name="citation244b"></a><a
href="#footnote244b" class="citation">[244b]</a>&nbsp; He
received a gracious assurance that he should have
satisfaction.&nbsp; Later there reached him</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;a second message from the Queen Regent
expressing Her Majesty&rsquo;s hope that Count Ofalia&rsquo;s
Note [of 11th May] would be satisfactory to me, and stating that
Her Ministers had so fully proved their incompetency by giving
any just cause of complaint to the Minister of Her only real
Friend and Ally, The Queen of England, that she should have
dismissed them, were it not that the state of affairs in the
Northern Provinces at this moment might be prejudiced by a change
of Government, which Her Majesty said she knew no one more than
myself would regret, but at the same time if I was not satisfied
I had only to state what I required and it should be immediately
complied with.&nbsp; My answer was confined to a grateful
acknowledgement of Her Majesty&rsquo;s condescension and
kindness.&nbsp; Count Ofalia has informed me that as President of
the Council He had enjoined all his Colleagues never to take any
step directly or indirectly concerning an Englishman without a
previous communication with Him as to its propriety, and I
therefore venture to hope that the case of Mr Borrow will not be
unattended with ultimate advantage to British subjects in
Spain.&rdquo; <a name="citation244c"></a><a href="#footnote244c"
class="citation">[244c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Note&rdquo; referred to by the Queen Regent in her
message was Count Ofalia&rsquo;s acquiescence in Sir George
Villiers&rsquo; demands, with the exception of the dismissal of
the Police Officer.&nbsp; His communication runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;11<i>th</i>
<i>May</i> 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The affair of Mr
Borrow is already decided by the Judge of First Instance and his
decision has been approved by the Superior or Territorial Court
of the Province.&nbsp; As I stated to you in my note of the
fourth last, the foundation of the arrest of Mr Borrow, who was
detained (and not committed), was an official communication from
the Agent of Police, Don Pedro Martin de Eugenio, in which he
averred that on intimating to Mr Borrow the written order of the
Civil Governor relative to the seizure of a book which he had
published and exposed for sale without complying with the forms
prescribed by the Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws of Spain, he (Mr
Borrow) had thrown on the floor the order of the Superior
Authority of the Province and used offensive expressions with
regard to the said Authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judicial proceedings have had for their object the
ascertainment of the fact.&nbsp; Mr Borrow has denied the truth
of the statement and the Agent of Police, who it appears entered
the lodgings of Mr Borrow without being accompanied by any one,
has been unable to confirm by evidence what he alleged in his
official report, or to produce the testimony of any one in
support of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This being the case the judge has declared and the
Territorial Court approved the superceding of the cause, putting
Mr Borrow immediately at complete liberty, with the express
declaration that the arrest he has suffered in no wise affects
his honor and good fame, and that the &lsquo;<i>celador</i> of
Public Security,&rsquo; Don Pedro Martin de Eugenio, be
admonished for the future to proceed in the discharge of his duty
with proper respect and circumspection according to the condition
and character of the persons whom he has to address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In accordance with the judicial decision and anxious to
give satisfaction to Mr Borrow, correcting at the same time the
fault of the Agent of Police in having presented himself without
being accompanied by any person in order to effect the seizure in
the lodging of Mr Borrow, Her Majesty has thought proper to
command that the aforesaid Don Pedro Martin de Eugenio be
suspended from his office for the space of Four Months, an order
which I shall communicate to the Minister of the Interior, and
that Mr Borrow be indemnified for the expenses which may have
been incurred by his lodging in the apartment of the Alcaide
(chief gaoler or Governor) for the days of his detention,
although even before the expiration of 24 hours after his arrest
he was permitted to return to his house under his word of honor
during the judicial proceedings, as I stated to you in my note
already cited.&nbsp; I flatter myself that in this determination
you as well as your Government will see a fresh proof of the
desire which animates that of H.M. the Queen Regent to maintain
and draw closer the relation of friendship and alliance existing
between the two countries.&nbsp; And with respect to the claim
advanced by Mr Borrow, and of which you also make mention in Your
Note of the 8th inst., I ought to declare to you that when the
Judge of First Instance received official information of the said
claim the business was already concluded in his tribunal, and
consequently there was nothing to be done.&nbsp; Without, for
this reason, there being understood any innovation with respect
to the matter of privilege (<i>fuero</i>) according as it is now
established.&rdquo; <a name="citation246a"></a><a
href="#footnote246a" class="citation">[246a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was liberated with unsullied honour on 12th May, after
twelve days&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; He refused the
compensation that Sir George Villiers had made a condition, and
later wrote to the Bible Society asking that there might be
deducted from the amount due to him the expenses of the twelve
days.&nbsp; He states also that he refused to acquiesce in the
dismissal of the Agent of Police, by which he doubtless means his
suspension, giving as a reason that there might be a wife and
family likely to suffer.&nbsp; In any case the man was only
carrying out his instructions.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s reason for
refusing the payment of his expenses was that he was unwilling to
afford them, the Spanish Government, an opportunity of saying
that after they had imprisoned an Englishman unjustly, and
without cause, he condescended to receive money at their hands.
<a name="citation246b"></a><a href="#footnote246b"
class="citation">[246b]</a></p>
<p>The greatest loss to Borrow, consequent upon his imprisonment,
no government could make good.&nbsp; His faithful Basque,
Francisco, had contracted typhus, or gaol fever, that was raging
at the time, and died within a few days of his master&rsquo;s
release.&nbsp; &ldquo;A more affectionate creature never
breathed,&rdquo; Borrow wrote to Mr Brandram.&nbsp; The poor
fellow, who, &ldquo;to the strength of a giant joined the
disposition of a lamb . . . was beloved even in the <i>patio</i>
of the prison, where he used to pitch the bar and wrestle with
the murderers and felons, always coming off victor.&rdquo; <a
name="citation247a"></a><a href="#footnote247a"
class="citation">[247a]</a>&nbsp; The next day Antonio presented
himself at Borrow&rsquo;s lodging, and without invitation or
comment assumed the duties he had relinquished in order that he
might enjoy the excitements of change.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who should
serve you now but myself?&rdquo; he asked when questioned as to
the meaning of his presence, &ldquo;N&rsquo;est pas que le sieur
Fran&ccedil;ois est mort!&rdquo; <a name="citation247b"></a><a
href="#footnote247b" class="citation">[247b]</a></p>
<p>John Hasfeldt&rsquo;s comment on his friend&rsquo;s
imprisonment was characteristic.&nbsp; In September 1838 he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The very last I heard of you is that you
have had the great good fortune to be stopping in the <i>carcel
de corte</i> at Madrid, which pleasing intelligence I found in
the <i>Preussiche Staats-Zeitung</i> this last spring.&nbsp; If
you were fatter no doubt the monks would have got up an <i>Auto
de F&eacute;</i> on your behalf, and you might easily have become
a nineteenth-century martyr.&nbsp; Then your strange life would
have been hawked about the streets of London for one penny,
though you never obtained a fat living to eat and drink and take
your ease after all the hardships you have endured.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
MAY&ndash;JULY 1838</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> was now to enter upon that
lengthy dispute with the Bible Society that almost brought about
an open breach, and eventually proved the indirect cause that led
to the severance of their relations.&nbsp; Graydon&rsquo;s
mistake lay in not contenting himself with printing and
distributing the Scriptures, of which he succeeded in getting rid
of an enormous quantity.&nbsp; He had advertised his association
with the Bible Society and proclaimed Borrow as a colleague, and
the authorities at Madrid were not greatly to blame for being
unable to distinguish between the two men.&nbsp; Whereas Graydon
and Rule, who was also extremely obnoxious to the Spanish Clergy,
were safe at Gibraltar or generally within easy reach of it,
Borrow was in the very midst of the enemy.&nbsp; He was not
unnaturally furiously angry at the situation that he conceived to
have been brought about by these evangelists in the south.&nbsp;
He referred to Graydon as the Evil Genius of the Society&rsquo;s
Cause in Spain.</p>
<p>It may be felt that Borrow was a prejudiced witness, he had
every reason for being so; but a despatch from Sir George
Villiers to the Consul at Malaga shows clearly how the British
Minister viewed Lieutenant Graydon&rsquo;s indiscretion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will communicate Count Ofalia&rsquo;s
note to Mr Graydon,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and tell him from me
that, feeling as I do a lively interest in the success of his
mission, I cannot but regret that he should have published his
opinions upon the Catholic religion and clergy in a form which
should render inevitable the interference of ecclesiastical
authority.&nbsp; I have no doubt that Mr Graydon, in the pursuit
of the meritorious task he has undertaken, is ready to endure
persecution, but he should bear in mind that it will not lead him
to success in this country, where prejudices are so inveterate,
and at this moment, when party spirit disfigures even the best
intentions.&nbsp; Unless Mr Graydon proceeds with the utmost
circumspection it will be impossible for me, with the prospect of
good result, to defend his conduct with the Government, for no
foreigner has a right, however laudable may be his object, to
seek the attainment of that object by infringing the laws of the
country in which he resides.&rdquo; <a name="citation249"></a><a
href="#footnote249" class="citation">[249]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In writing to Mr Brandram, Borrow pointed out that although he
had travelled extensively in Spain and had established many
dep&ocirc;ts for the sale of the Scriptures, not one word of
complaint had been transmitted to the Government.&nbsp; He had
been imprisoned; but he had the authority of Count Ofalia for
saying that it was not on account of his own, but rather of the
action of others.&nbsp; Furthermore the Premier had advised him
to endeavour to make friends among the clergy, and for the
present at least make no further effort to promote the actual
sale of the New Testament in Madrid.</p>
<p>On the day following his release from prison (13th May)
Borrow, after being sent for by the British Minister, wrote to Mr
Brandram as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir George has commanded me . . . to write
to the following effect:&mdash;Mr Graydon must leave Spain, or
the Bible Society must publicly disavow that his proceedings
receive their encouragement, unless they wish to see the Sacred
book, which it is their object to distribute, brought into
universal odium and contempt.&nbsp; He has lately been to Malaga,
and has there played precisely the same part which he acted last
year at Valencia, with the addition that in printed writings he
has insulted the Spanish Government in the most inexcusable
manner.&nbsp; A formal complaint of his conduct has been sent up
from Malaga, and a copy of one of his writings.&nbsp; Sir George
blushed when he saw it, and informed Count Ofalia that any steps
which might be taken towards punishing the author would receive
no impediment from him.&nbsp; I shall not make any observation on
this matter farther than stating that I have never had any other
opinion of Mr Graydon than that he is insane&mdash;insane as the
person who for the sake of warming his own hands would set a
street on fire.&nbsp; Sir George said to-day that he (Graydon)
was the cause of my <i>harmless</i> shop being closed at Madrid
and also of my imprisonment.&nbsp; The Society will of course
communicate with Sir George on the subject, I wash my hands of
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 23rd May Borrow wrote again to Mr Brandram:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the name of the <i>Most Highest</i> take
steps for preventing that miserable creature Graydon from ruining
us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s use of the term
&ldquo;insane&rdquo; with regard to Graydon was fully
justified.&nbsp; The Rev. W. H. Rule wrote to him on 14th
May:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our worthy brother Graydon is, I suppose, in
Granada.&nbsp; I overtook him in Cartagena, endured the process
of osculation, saw him without rhime or reason wrangle with and
publicly insult our Consul there.&nbsp; Had his company in the
steamer to Almeria, much to my discomfort.&nbsp; Never was a man
fuller of love and impudence, compounded in the most provoking
manner.&nbsp; In Malaga, just as we were to part, he broke out
into a strain highly disagreeable, and I therefore thought it a
convenient occasion to tell him that I should have no more to do
with him.&nbsp; I left him dancing and raving like an
energumen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter Borrow indiscreetly sent to Mr Brandram, much to
Mr Rule&rsquo;s regret, who wrote to Mr Brandram, saying that
whilst he had nothing to retract, he would not have written for
the eyes of the Bible Society&rsquo;s Committee what he had
written to Borrow.&nbsp; To Mr Rule Lieut. Graydon was &ldquo;a
good man, or at least a well-meaning [one], who has not the
balance of judgment and temper necessary for the situation he
occupies.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was given to &ldquo;the promulgation of
Millenianism,&rdquo; and to calling the Bible &ldquo;the true
book of the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mann had confirmed all the rumours current about
Graydon.&nbsp; In order to remove from his shoulders &ldquo;the
burden of obloquy,&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s first act on leaving
prison was to publish in the <i>Correo Nacional</i> an
advertisement disclaiming, in the name of the Bible Society, any
writings which may have been circulated tending to lower the
authorities, civil and ecclesiastical, in the eyes of the
people.&nbsp; He denied that it was the Society&rsquo;s intention
or wish to make proselytes from the Roman Catholic form of
worship, and that it was at all times prepared to extend the hand
of brotherhood to the Spanish clergy.&nbsp; This notice was
signed &ldquo;George Borrow, Sole authorised Agent of the British
and Foreign Bible Society in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>El Gazeta Oficial</i> in commenting on the situation, saw
in the anti-Catholic tracts circulated by Graydon &ldquo;part of
the monstrous plan, whose existence can no longer be called in
question, concocted by the enemies of all public order, for the
purpose of inaugurating on our unhappy soil a <i>social</i>
revolution, just as the political one is drawing to a
close.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Government was urged to allow no longer
these attacks upon the religion of the country.&nbsp; Rather
illogically the article concludes by paying a tribute to the
Bible Society, &ldquo;considered not under the religious but the
social aspect.&rdquo;&nbsp; After praising its prudence for
&ldquo;accommodating itself to the civil and ecclesiastical laws
of each country, and by adopting the editions there
current,&rdquo; it concludes with the sophisticated argument
that, &ldquo;if the great object be the propagation of evangelic
maxims, the notes are no obstacle, and by preserving them we
fulfil our religious principle of not permitting to private
reason the interpretation of the Sacred Word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General Committee expressed themselves, somewhat
enigmatically, it must be confessed, as in no way surprised at
this article, being from past experience learned enough in the
ways of Rome to anticipate her.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That advertisement,&rdquo; Borrow wrote six
months later in his Report that was subsequently withdrawn,
&ldquo;gave infinite satisfaction to the liberal clergy.&nbsp; I
was complimented for it by the Primate of Spain, who said I had
redeemed my credit and that of the Society, and it is with some
feeling of pride that I state that it choked and prevented the
publication of a series of terrible essays against the Bible
Society, which were intended for the Official Gazette, and which
were written by the Licentiate Albert Lister, the editor of that
journal, the friend of Blanco White, and the most talented man in
Spain.&nbsp; These essays still exist in the editorial drawer,
and were communicated to me by the head manager of the royal
printing office, my respected friend and countryman Mr Charles
Wood, whose evidence in this matter and in many others I can
command at pleasure.&nbsp; In lieu of which essays came out a
mild and conciliatory article by the same writer, which, taking
into consideration the country in which it was written, and its
peculiar circumstances, was an encouragement to the Bible Society
to proceed, although with secrecy and caution; yet this article,
sadly misunderstood in England, gave rise to communications from
home highly mortifying to myself and ruinous to the Bible
cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow had written from prison to Mr Brandram <a
name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a> telling him that it had &ldquo;pleased
God to confer upon me the highest of mortal honors, the privilege
of bearing chains for His sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; After describing how
it had always been his practice, before taking any step, to
consult with Sir George Villiers and receive his approval, and
that the present situation had not been brought about by any
rashness on his, Borrow&rsquo;s, part, he proceeds to convey the
following curious piece of information that must have caused some
surprise at Earl Street:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will now state a fact, which speaks
volumes as to the state of affairs at Madrid.&nbsp; My
arch-enemy, the Archbishop of Toledo, the primate of Spain,
wishes to give me the kiss of brotherly Peace.&nbsp; He has
caused a message to be conveyed to me in my dungeon, assuring me
that he has had no share in causing my imprisonment, which he
says was the work of the Civil Governor, who was incited to the
step by the Jesuits.&nbsp; He adds that he is determined to seek
out my persecutors amongst the clergy, and to have them punished,
and that when I leave prison he shall be happy to co-operate with
me in the dissemination of the Gospel!!&nbsp; I cannot write much
now, for I am not well, having been bled and blistered.&nbsp; I
must, however, devote a few lines to another subject, but not one
of rejoicing or Christian exultation.&nbsp; Mann arrived just
after my arrest, and visited me in prison, and there favoured me
with a scene of despair, abject despair, which nearly turned my
brain.&nbsp; I despised the creature, God forgive me, but I
pitied him; for he was without money and expected every moment to
be seized like myself and incarcerated, and he is by no means
anxious to be invested with the honors of martyrdom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the Primate of Spain should have sent to Borrow such a
message is surprising; but what is still more so is that six days
later Borrow wrote telling Mr Brandram that he had asked a bishop
to arrange an interview between him and the Archbishop of Toledo,
and Sir George Villiers, who was present, begged the same
privilege. <a name="citation253"></a><a href="#footnote253"
class="citation">[253]</a>&nbsp; On 23rd May Borrow wrote again
to Mr Brandram: &ldquo;I have just had an interview with the
Archbishop.&nbsp; It was satisfactory to a degree I had not dared
to hope for.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his next letter (25th May) he
writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have had, as you are aware, an interview
with the Archbishop of Toledo.&nbsp; I have not time to state
particulars, but he said amongst other things, &lsquo;Be prudent,
the Government are disposed to arrange matters amicably, and I am
disposed to co-operate with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; At parting he
shook me most kindly by the hand saying that he liked me.&nbsp;
Sir George intends to visit him in a few days.&nbsp; He is an
old, venerable-looking man, between seventy and eighty.&nbsp;
When I saw him he was dressed with the utmost simplicity, with
the exception of a most splendid amethyst ring, the lustre of
which was truly dazzling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is only one conclusion to be drawn from this
archiepiscopal condescension, if the interview were not indeed
sought by Borrow, that it was a political move to pacify the
wounded feelings of an outraged Englishman at a time when the
goodwill of England was as necessary to the kingdom of Spain as
the sun itself.</p>
<p>The upshot of the Malaga Incident was that &ldquo;the Spanish
Government resolved to put an end to Bible transactions in Spain,
and forthwith gave orders for the seizure of all the Bibles and
Testaments in the country, wherever they might be deposited or
exposed for sale.&nbsp; They notified Sir George Villiers of the
decision, expressly stating that the resolution was taken in
consequence of the &lsquo;<i>Ocurrido en
Malaga</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation254a"></a><a
href="#footnote254a" class="citation">[254a]</a>&nbsp; The letter
in which Sir George Villiers was informed of the
Government&rsquo;s decision runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Madrid</span>, 19<i>th</i> <i>May</i> 1838.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform You that in consequence of what has
taken place at Malaga and other places, respecting the
publication and sale of the Bible translated by Padre Scio, which
are not complete (since they do not contain all the Books which
the Catholic Church recognises as Canonical) nor even being
complete could they be printed unless furnished with the Notes of
the said Padre Scio, according to the existing regulations; Her
Majesty has thought proper to prevent this publication and sale,
but without insulting or molesting those British Subjects who for
some time past have been introducing them into the Kingdom and
selling them at the lowest prices, thinking they were conferring
a benefit when in reality they were doing an injury.</p>
<p>I have also to state to You that in order to carry this Royal
determination into effect, orders have been issued to prohibit
its being printed in Spain, in the vulgar tongue, unless it
should be the entire Bible as recognised by the Catholic Church
with corresponding Notes, preventing its admittance at the
Frontiers, as is the case with books printed in Spanish abroad;
that the Bibles exposed for public sale be seized and given to
their owners in a packet marked and sealed, upon the condition of
its being sent out of the country through the Custom Houses on
the Frontier or at the Ports.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I avail myself, etc., etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The Count of
Ofalia</span>. <a name="citation255a"></a><a href="#footnote255a"
class="citation">[255a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow and Graydon were advised of this inhibition, and both
ordered their establishments for the sale of books to be closed,
thus showing that they were &ldquo;Gentlemen who are animated
with due respect for the Laws of Spain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b"
class="citation">[255b]</a>&nbsp; At Valladolid, Santiago,
Orviedo, Pontevedra, Seville, Salamanca, and Malaga the decree
was at once enforced.&nbsp; On learning that the books at his
dep&ocirc;ts had all been seized, Borrow became apprehensive for
the safety of his Madrid stock of New Testaments, some three
thousand in number.&nbsp; He accordingly had them removed, under
cover of darkness, to the houses of his friends.</p>
<p>Borrow was not the man to accept defeat, and he wrote to Mr
Brandram with great cheerfulness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This, however, gives me little uneasiness,
for, with the blessing of God, I shall be able to repair all,
always provided I am allowed to follow my own plans, and to avail
myself of the advantages which have lately been
opened&mdash;especially to cultivate the kind feeling lately
manifested towards me by the principal Spanish clergy.&rdquo; <a
name="citation255c"></a><a href="#footnote255c"
class="citation">[255c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another bitter cup has been filled for my
swallowing.&nbsp; The Bible Society and myself have been accused
of blasphemy, sedition, etc.&nbsp; A collection of tracts has
been seized in Murcia, in which the Catholic religion and its
dogmas are handled with the most abusive severity; <a
name="citation256a"></a><a href="#footnote256a"
class="citation">[256a]</a> these books have been sworn to as
having been left <i>by the Committee of the Bible Society whilst
in that town</i>, and Count Ofalia has been called upon to sign
an order for my arrest and banishment from Spain.&nbsp; Sir
George, however, advises me to remain quiet and not to be
alarmed, as he will answer for my innocence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation256b"></a><a href="#footnote256b"
class="citation">[256b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow strove to galvanise the General Committee into
action.&nbsp; The Spanish newspapers were inflamed against the
Society as a sectarian, not a Christian institution.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Zeal is a precious thing,&rdquo; he told Mr Brandram,
&ldquo;when accompanied with one grain of common
sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; The theme of his letters was the removal of
Graydon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not be cast down,&rdquo; he writes;
&ldquo;all will go well if the stumbling block [Graydon] be
removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s state of mind may well be imagined, and if by
his impulsive letters he unwittingly harmed his own cause at Earl
Street, he did so as a man whose liberty, perhaps his life even,
was being jeopardised, although not deliberately, by another whom
the reforming spirit seemed likely to carry to any excess.&nbsp;
It must be admitted that for the time being Borrow had forgotten
the idiom of Earl Street.</p>
<p>The president (a bishop) of the body of ecclesiastics that was
engaged in examining the Society&rsquo;s Spanish Bible,
communicated with Borrow, through Mr Charles Wood, the suggestion
that &ldquo;the Committee of the Bible Society should in the
present exigency draw up an exposition of their views respecting
Spain, stating what they are prepared to do and what they are not
prepared to do; above all, whether in seeking to circulate the
Gospel in this Country they harbour any projects hostile to the
Government or the established religion; moreover, whether the
late distribution of tracts was done by their connivance or
authority, and whether they are disposed to sanction in future
the publication in Spain of such a class of writings.&rdquo; <a
name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was of the opinion that this should be done, although
he would not take upon himself to advise the Committee upon such
a point, he merely remarked that &ldquo;the Prelate in question
is a most learned and respectable man, and one of the warmest of
our friends.&rdquo; <a name="citation257b"></a><a
href="#footnote257b" class="citation">[257b]</a>&nbsp; The
Society very naturally declined to commit itself to any such
undertaking.&nbsp; It would not have been quite logical or
conceivable that a Protestant body should give a guarantee that
it harboured no projects hostile to Rome.</p>
<p>Undeterred by the official edict against the circulation in
Spain of the Scriptures, Borrow wrote to Mr Brandram (14th
June):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should wish to make another Biblical tour
this summer, until the storm be blown over.&nbsp; Should I
undertake such an expedition, I should avoid the towns and devote
myself entirely to the peasantry.&nbsp; I have sometimes thought
of visiting the villages of the Alpujarra Mountains in Andalusia,
where the people live quite secluded from the world; what do you
think of my project?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this time Borrow had heard nothing from Earl Street as to
the effect being produced there by his letters.&nbsp; On 15th or
16th June he received a long letter from Mr Brandram enclosing
the Resolutions of the General Committee with regard to the
crisis.&nbsp; They proved conclusively that the officials failed
entirely to appreciate the state of affairs in Spain, and the
critical situation of their paid and accredited agent, George
Borrow.&nbsp; Their pride had probably been wounded by
Borrow&rsquo;s impetuous requests, that might easily have
appeared to them in the light of commands.&nbsp; It may have
struck some that the Spanish affairs of the Society were being
administered from Madrid, and that they themselves were being
told, not what it was expedient to do, but what they <i>must</i>
do.&nbsp; Another factor in the situation was the
Committee&rsquo;s friendliness for their impulsive, unsalaried
servant Lieut. Graydon, who was certainly a picturesque, almost
melodramatic figure.&nbsp; In any case the letter from Mr
Brandram that accompanied the Resolutions was couched in a strain
of fair play to Graydon that became a thinly disguised
partizanship.&nbsp; At the meeting of the Committee held on 28th
May the following Resolutions had been adopted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>First</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;That Mr Borrow be
requested to inform Sir George Villiers that this Committee have
written to Mr Graydon through their Secretary, desiring him to
leave Spain on account of his personal safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Second</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;That Mr Borrow be informed that in
the absence of specific documents, this Committee cannot offer
any opinion on the proceedings of Mr Graydon, and that therefore
he be desired to obtain, either in original or copy, the
objectionable papers alleged to have been issued by Mr Graydon
and to transmit them hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Third</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;That Mr Borrow be requested not to
repeat the Advertisement contained in the <i>Corr&eacute;o
Nacional</i> of the 17th inst., and that he be cautioned how he
commits the Society by advertisements of a similar
character.&nbsp; And further, that he be desired to state to Sir
George Villiers that the advertisement in question was inserted
by him on the spur of the moment, and without any opportunity of
obtaining instructions from this Committee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In justice to the Committee, it must be said that they did not
appreciate the delicacy of the situation, being only Christians
and not diplomatists.&nbsp; Perhaps they were unaware that the
<i>whole of Spain was under martial law</i>, or if they were, the
true significance of the fact failed to strike them.&nbsp; Mr
Brandram&rsquo;s letter accompanying these Resolutions is little
more than an amplification of the Committee&rsquo;s decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have, I assure you,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;endeavoured to place myself in your situation and enter
into your feelings strongly excited by the irreparable mischief
which you suppose Mr G. to have done to our cause so dear to
you.&nbsp; Under the influence of these feelings you have written
with, what appears to us, unmitigated severity of his
conduct.&nbsp; But now, let me entreat you to enter into our
feelings a little, and to consider what we owe to Mr
Graydon.&nbsp; If we have at times thought him imprudent, we have
seen enough in him to make us both admire and love him.&nbsp; He
has ever approved himself as an upright, faithful, conscientious,
indefatigable agent; one who has shrunk from no trials and no
dangers; one who has gone through in our service many and
extraordinary hardships.&nbsp; What have we against him at
present?&nbsp; He has issued certain documents of a very
offensive character, as is alleged.&nbsp; We have not seen them,
neither does it appear that you have, but that you speak from the
recollections of Mr Sothern.&rdquo; <a name="citation259"></a><a
href="#footnote259" class="citation">[259]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter goes on to say that if it can be shown that Lieut.
Graydon is acting in the same manner as he did in Valencia, for
which he was admonished,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;he will assuredly be recalled on this
ground.&nbsp; You wonder perhaps that we for a moment doubt the
fact of his reiterated imprudence; but <i>audi alteram partem</i>
must be our rule&mdash;and besides, on reviewing the Valencia
proceedings, we draw a wide distinction.&nbsp; Had he been as
free, as you suppose him to be, of the trammels of office in our
service, many would say and think that he was prefectly at
liberty to act and speak as he did of the Authorities, if he
chose to take the consequences.&nbsp; Really in such a country it
is no marvel if his Spirit has been stirred within him!&nbsp;
Will you allow me to remind you of the strong things in your own
letter to the Valencia ecclesiastic, the well pointed and oft
repeated V&aelig;!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Brandram points out that strong language is frequently the
sword of the Reformer, and that there are times when it has the
highest sanction; but</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the judgment of all [the members of the
Committee] will be that an Agent of the Bible Society is a
Reformer, not by his preaching or denouncing, but by the
distribution of the Bible.&nbsp; If Mr G&rsquo;s. conduct is no
worse than it was in Valencia,&rdquo; the letter continues,
rather inconsistently, in the light of the assurance in the early
part that recall would be the punishment for another such lapse
into indiscretion, &ldquo;you must not expect anything beyond a
qualified disavowal of it, and that simply as unbecoming an Agent
of such a Society as ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what I have written, you will hardly feel
surprised that our Committee could not quite approve of your
Advertisement.&nbsp; We have ever regarded Mr Graydon as much our
Agent as yourself.&nbsp; In three of our printed reports in
succession we make no difference in speaking of you both.&nbsp;
We are anxious to do nothing to weaken your hands at so important
a crisis, and we conceive that the terms we have employed in our
Resolution are the mildest we could have used.&nbsp; Do not
insert the Advertisement a second time.&nbsp; Let it pass; let it
be forgotten.&nbsp; If necessary we shall give the public
intimation that Mr G. was, but is not our agent any longer.&nbsp;
Remember, we entreat you, the very delicate position that such a
manifesto places us in, as well as the effect which it may have
on Mr Graydon&rsquo;s personal safety.&nbsp; We give you full
credit for believing it was your duty, under the peculiar
circumstances of the case, to take so decided and bold a step,
and that you thought yourself fully justified by the distinction
of salaried and unsalaried Agent, in speaking of yourself as the
alone accredited Agent of the Society.&nbsp; Possibly when you
reflect a little upon the matter you may view it in another
light.&nbsp; There are besides some sentiments in the
Advertisement which we cannot perhaps fully accord with . .
.&nbsp; If to our poor friend there has befallen the saddest of
all calamities to which you allude, should we not speak of him
with all tenderness.&nbsp; If he be insane I believe much of it
is to be attributed to that entire devotion with which he has
devoted himself to our work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No complaint can be urged against the Committee for refusing
to condemn one of their agents unheard, and without documentary
evidence; but it was strange that they should pass resolutions
that contained no word of sympathy with Borrow for his sufferings
in a typhus-infested prison.&nbsp; It is even more strange that
the covering letter should refer to Graydon&rsquo;s sufferings
and hardships and the danger to his person, without apparently
realising that Borrow <i>had actually</i> suffered what the
Committee feared that Graydon <i>might</i> suffer.&nbsp; There is
no doubt that Borrow&rsquo;s impulsive letters had greatly
offended everybody at Earl Street, where Lieut. Graydon appears
to have been extremely popular; and the few words of sympathy
with Borrow that might have saved much acrimonious correspondence
were neither resolved nor written.</p>
<p>The other side of the picture is shown in a vigorous passage
from Borrow&rsquo;s Report, which was afterwards withdrawn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A helpless widow [the mother of Don Pascual
Mann] was insulted, her liberty of conscience invaded, and her
only son incited to rebellion against her.&nbsp; A lunatic
[Lieut. Graydon] was employed as the <i>repartidor</i>, or
distributor, of the Blessed Bible, who, having his head crammed
with what he understood not, ran through the streets of Valencia
crying aloud that Christ was nigh at hand and would appear in a
short time, whilst advertisements to much the same effect were
busily circulated, in which the name, the noble name, of the
Bible Society was prostituted; whilst the Bible, exposed for sale
in the apartment of a public house, served for little more than a
decoy to the idle and curious, who were there treated with
incoherent railings against the Church of Rome and Babylon in a
dialect which it was well for the deliverer that only a few of
the audience understood.&nbsp; But I fly from these details, and
will now repeat the consequences of the above proceedings to
myself; for I, I, and only I, as every respectable person in
Madrid can vouch, have paid the penalty for them all, though as
innocent as the babe who has not yet seen the light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the General Committee at a period of anxiety and annoyance
failed to pay tribute to Borrow&rsquo;s many qualities, the
official historian of the Society makes good the omission when he
describes him as &ldquo;A strange, impulsive, more or less
inflammable creature as he must have occasionally seemed to the
Secretaries and Editorial Superintendent, he had proved himself a
man of exceptional ability, energy, tact, prudence&mdash;above
all, a man whose heart was in his work.&rdquo; <a
name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a></p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s acknowledgment of the Resolutions was dated
16th June.&nbsp; It ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have received your communication of the
30th ult. containing the resolutions of the Committee, to which I
shall of course attend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of your letter in general, permit me to state that I
reverence the spirit in which it is written, and am perfectly
disposed to admit the correctness of the views which it exhibits;
but it appears to me that in one or two instances I have been
misunderstood in the letters which I have addressed [to you] on
the subject of Graydon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bear this unfortunate gentleman no ill will, God
forbid, and it will give me pain if he were reprimanded publicly
or privately; moreover, I can see no utility likely to accrue
from such a proceeding.&nbsp; All that I have stated hitherto is
the damage which he has done in Spain to the cause and myself, by
the&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;imprudence of his conduct;
and the idea which I have endeavoured to inculcate is the
absolute necessity of his leaving Spain instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take now in good part what I am about to say, and O! do
not misunderstand me!&nbsp; I owe a great deal to the Bible
Society, and the Bible Society owes nothing to me.&nbsp; I am
well aware and am always disposed to admit that it can find
thousands more zealous, more active, and in every respect more
adapted to transact its affairs and watch over its interests;
yet, with this consciousness of my own inutility, I must be
permitted to state that, linked to a man like Graydon, I can no
longer consent to be, and that if the Society expect such a
thing, I must take the liberty of retiring, perhaps to the wilds
of Tartary or the Zingani camps of Siberia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name at present is become public property, no very
enviable distinction in these unhappy times, and neither wished
nor sought by myself.&nbsp; I have of late been subjected to
circumstances which have rendered me obnoxious to the hatred of
those who never forgive, the Bloody Church of Rome, which I have
[no] doubt will sooner or later find means to accomplish my ruin;
for no one is better aware than myself of its fearful resources,
whether in England or Spain, in Italy or in any other part.&nbsp;
I should not be now in this situation had I been permitted to act
alone.&nbsp; How much more would have been accomplished, it does
not become me to guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had as many or more difficulties to surmount in
Russia than I originally had here, yet all that the Society
expected or desired was effected, without stir or noise, and that
in the teeth of an imperial <i>Ukase</i> which forbade the work
which I was employed to superintend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concerning my late affair, I must here state that I was
sent to prison on a charge which was subsequently acknowledged
not only to be false but ridiculous; I was accused of uttering
words disrespectful towards the <i>Gef&eacute; Politico</i> of
Madrid; my accuser was an officer of the police, who entered my
apartment one morning before I was dressed, and commenced
searching my papers and flinging my books into disorder.&nbsp;
Happily, however, the people of the house, who were listening at
the door, heard all that passed, and declared on oath that so far
from mentioning the <i>Gef&eacute; Politico</i>, I merely told
the officer that he, the officer, was an insolent fellow, and
that I would cause him to be punished.&nbsp; He subsequently
confessed that he was an instrument of the Vicar General, and
that he merely came to my apartment in order to obtain a pretence
for making a complaint.&nbsp; He has been dismissed from his
situation and the Queen [Regent] has expressed her sorrow at my
imprisonment.&nbsp; If there be any doubt entertained on the
matter, pray let Sir George Villiers be written to!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be happy to hear what success attends our
efforts in China.&nbsp; I hope a prudent conduct has been
adopted; for think not that a strange and loud language will find
favour in the eyes of the Chinese; and above all, I hope that we
have not got into war with the Augustines and their followers,
who, if properly managed, may be of incalculable service in
propagating the Scriptures . . . <i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The Documents,
or some of them, shall be sent as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nine days later (25th June) Borrow wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I now await your orders.&nbsp; I wish to
know whether I am at liberty to pursue the course which may seem
to me best under existing circumstances, and which at present
appears to be to mount my horses, which are neighing in the
stable, and once more betake myself to the plains and mountains
of dusty Spain, and to dispose of my Testaments to the muleteers
and peasants.&nbsp; By doing so I shall employ myself usefully,
and at the same time avoid giving offence.&nbsp; Better days will
soon arrive, which will enable me to return to Madrid and reopen
my shop, till then, however, I should wish to pursue my labours
in comparative obscurity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replying to Borrow&rsquo;s letter of 16th June, Mr Brandram
wrote (29th June): &ldquo;I trust we shall not easily forget your
services in St Petersburg, but suffer me to remind you that when
you came to the point of distribution your success ended.&rdquo;
<a name="citation265a"></a><a href="#footnote265a"
class="citation">[265a]</a>&nbsp; This altogether unworthy remark
was neither creditable to the writer nor to the distinguished
Society on whose behalf he wrote.&nbsp; Borrow had done all that
a man was capable of to distribute the books.&nbsp; His reply was
dignified and effective.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was unkind and unjust to taunt me with
having been unsuccessful in distributing the Scriptures.&nbsp;
Allow me to state that no other person under the same
circumstances would have distributed the tenth part; yet had I
been utterly unsuccessful, it would have been wrong to check me
with being so, after all I have undergone, and with how little of
that are you acquainted.&rdquo; <a name="citation265b"></a><a
href="#footnote265b" class="citation">[265b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response, Mr Brandram wrote (28th July):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have considered that I have taunted you
with want of success in St Petersburg.&nbsp; I thought that the
way in which I introduced that subject would have prevented any
such unpleasant and fanciful impression.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was all!&nbsp; It became evident to all at Earl Street
that a conference between Borrow, the Officials and the General
Committee was imperative if the air were to be cleared of the
rancour that seemed to increase with each interchange of letters.
<a name="citation265c"></a><a href="#footnote265c"
class="citation">[265c]</a>&nbsp; Unless something were done, a
breach seemed inevitable, a thing the Society did not appear to
desire.&nbsp; When Borrow first became aware that he was wanted
at Earl Street for the purpose of a personal conference, he in
all probability conceived it to be tantamount to a recall, and he
was averse from leaving the field to the enemy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the name of the Highest,&rdquo; he
wrote, <a name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a> &ldquo;I entreat you all to banish
such a preposterous idea; a journey home (provided you intend
that I should return to Spain) could lead to no result but
expense and the loss of precious time.&nbsp; I have nothing to
explain to you which you are not already perfectly well
acquainted with by my late letters.&nbsp; I was fully aware at
the time I was writing them that I should afford you little
satisfaction, for the plain unvarnished truth is seldom
agreeable; but I now repeat, and these are perhaps among the last
words which I shall ever be permitted to pen, that I cannot
approve, and I am sure no Christian can, of the system which has
lately been pursued in the large sea-port cities of Spain, and
which the Bible Society has been supposed to sanction,
notwithstanding the most unreflecting person could easily foresee
that such a line of conduct could produce nothing in the end but
obloquy and misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow saw that his departure from Spain would be construed by
his enemies as flight, and that their joy would be great in
consequence.</p>
<p>The Spanish authorities were determined if possible to rid the
country of missionaries.&nbsp; The <i>Gazeta Oficial</i> of
Madrid drew attention to the fact that in Valencia there had been
distributed thousands of pamphlets &ldquo;against the religion we
profess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir George Villiers enquired into the
matter and found that there was no evidence that the pamphlets
had been written, printed, or published in England; and when
writing to Count Ofalia on the subject he informed him that the
Bible Society distributed, not tracts or controversial writings,
but the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The next move on the part of the authorities was to produce
sworn testimony from three people (all living in the same house,
by the way) that they had purchased copies of &ldquo;the New
Testament and other Biblical translations at the <i>Despacho</i>
on 5th May.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was in prison at the time, and
his assistant denied the sale.&nbsp; Documents were also produced
proving that the imprint on the title-page of the Scio New
Testament was false, as at the time it was printed no such
printer as Andr&eacute;as Borr&eacute;go (who by the way was the
Government printer and at one time a candidate for cabinet rank)
lived in Madrid.&nbsp; In drawing the British Minister&rsquo;s
attention to these matters, Count Ofalia wrote (31st May):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would be opportune if you would be
pleased to advise Mr Borrow that, convinced of the inutility of
his efforts for propagating here the translation in the vulgar
tongue of Sacred Writings without the forms required by law, he
would do much better in making use of his talents in some other
class of scientifical or literary Works during his residence in
Spain, giving up Biblical Enterprises, which may be useful in
other countries, but which in this Kingdom are prejudicial for
very obvious reasons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
JULY&ndash;NOVEMBER 1838</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s</span> spirit chafed under
this spell of enforced idleness.&nbsp; His horses were neighing
in the stable and &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Antonio was neighing in the
house,&rdquo; as Maria Diaz expressed it; and for himself, Borrow
required something more actively stimulating than pen and ink
encounters with Mr Brandram.&nbsp; He therefore determined to
defy the prohibition and make an excursion into the rural
districts of New Castile, offering his Testaments for sale as he
went, and sending on supplies ahead.&nbsp; His first objective
was Villa Seca, a village situated on the banks of the Tagus
about nine leagues from Madrid.</p>
<p>He was aware of the danger he ran in thus disregarding the
official decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will not conceal from you,&rdquo; he
writes to Mr Brandram on 14th July, &ldquo;that I am playing a
daring game, and it is very possible that when I least expect it
I may be seized, tied to the tail of a mule, and dragged either
to the prison of Toledo or Madrid.&nbsp; Yet such a prospect does
not discourage me in the least, but rather urges me on to
persevere; for I assure you, and in this assertion there lurks
not the slightest desire to magnify myself and produce an effect,
that I am eager to lay down my life in this cause, and whether a
Carlist&rsquo;s bullet or a gaol-fever bring my career to an end,
I am perfectly indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was not averse from martyrdom; but he objected to being
precipitated into it by another man&rsquo;s folly.&nbsp; In his
interview with Count Ofalia, he had been solemnly warned that if
a second time he came within the clutches of the authorities he
might not escape so easily, and had replied that it was &ldquo;a
pleasant thing to be persecuted for the Gospel&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his decision to make Villa Seca his temporary headquarters,
Borrow had been influenced by the fact that it was the home of
Maria Diaz, his friend and landlady.&nbsp; Her husband was there
working on the land, Maria herself living in Madrid that her
children might be properly educated.&nbsp; Borrow left Madrid on
10th July, and on his arrival at Villa Seca he was cordially
welcomed by Juan Lopez, the husband of Maria Diaz, who continued
to use her maiden name, in accordance with Spanish custom.&nbsp;
Lopez subsequently proved of the greatest possible assistance in
the work of distribution, shaming both Borrow and Antonio by his
energy and powers of endurance.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Villa Seca and the surrounding villages of
Bargas, Coveja, Villa Luenga, Mocejon, Yuncl&eacute;r eagerly
bought up &ldquo;the book of life,&rdquo; and each day the three
men rode forth in heat so great that &ldquo;the very
<i>arrieros</i> frequently fall dead from their mules, smitten by
a sun-stroke.&rdquo; <a name="citation269a"></a><a
href="#footnote269a" class="citation">[269a]</a></p>
<p>It was in Villa Seca that Borrow found &ldquo;all that gravity
of deportment and chivalry of disposition which Cervantes is said
to have sneered away&rdquo; <a name="citation269b"></a><a
href="#footnote269b" class="citation">[269b]</a> and there were
to be heard &ldquo;those grandiose expressions which, when met
with in the romances of chivalry, are scoffed at as ridiculous
exaggerations.&rdquo; <a name="citation269c"></a><a
href="#footnote269c" class="citation">[269c]</a>&nbsp; Borrow so
charmed the people of the district with the elaborate formality
of his manner, that he became convinced that any attempt to
arrest or do him harm would have met with a violent resistance,
even to the length of the drawing of knives in his defence.</p>
<p>In less than a week some two hundred Testaments had been
disposed of, and a fresh supply had to be obtained from
Madrid.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s methods had now changed.&nbsp; He
had, of necessity, to make as little stir as possible in order to
avoid an unenviable notoriety.&nbsp; He carefully eschewed
advertisements and handbills, and limited himself almost entirely
to the simple statement that he brought to the people &ldquo;the
words and life of the Saviour and His Saints at a price adapted
to their humble means.&rdquo; <a name="citation270a"></a><a
href="#footnote270a" class="citation">[270a]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note in connection with this period of
Borrow&rsquo;s activities in Spain, that in 1908 one of the sons
of Maria Diaz and Juan Lopez was sought out at Villa Seca by a
representative of the Bible Society, and interrogated as to
whether he remembered Borrow.&nbsp; Eduardo Lopez (then
seventy-four years of age) stated that he was a child of eight <a
name="citation270b"></a><a href="#footnote270b"
class="citation">[270b]</a> when Borrow lived at the house of his
mother; yet he remembers that &ldquo;<i>El
ingl&eacute;s</i>&rdquo; was tall and robust, with fair hair
turning grey.&nbsp; Eduardo and his young brother regarded Borrow
with both fear and respect; for, their father being absent, he
used to punish them for misdemeanours by setting them on the
table and making them remain perfectly quiet for a considerable
time.&nbsp; The old man remembered that Borrow had two horses
whom he called &ldquo;la Jaca&rdquo; and &ldquo;el
Mondr&aacute;gon,&rdquo; and that he used to take to the house of
Maria Diaz &ldquo;his trunk full of books which were beautifully
bound.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remembered Borrow&rsquo;s Greek servant,
&ldquo;Antonio Guchino&rdquo; (the Antonio Buchini of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>), who spoke very bad Spanish.</p>
<p>The most interesting of Eduardo Lopez&rsquo; recollections of
Borrow was that he &ldquo;often recited a chant which nobody
understood,&rdquo; and of which the old man could remember only
the following fragment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sed un la in la en la la<br />
Sino Mokhamente de resu la.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been suggested, <a name="citation271a"></a><a
href="#footnote271a" class="citation">[271a]</a> and with every
show of probability, that &ldquo;this is the Moslem
<i>kalimah</i> or creed which he had heard sung from the
minarets&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La illaha illa allah<br />
Wa Muhammad rasoul allah.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow recognised that he must not stay very long in any one
place, and accordingly it was his intention, as soon as he had
supplied the immediate wants of the Sagra (the plain) of Toledo,
&ldquo;to cross the country to Aranjuez, and endeavour to supply
with the Word the villages on the frontier of La Mancha.&rdquo;
<a name="citation271b"></a><a href="#footnote271b"
class="citation">[271b]</a>&nbsp; As he was on the point of
setting out, however, he received two letters from Mr Brandram,
which decided him to return immediately to Madrid instead of
pursuing his intended route.</p>
<p>Borrow was informed that if, after consulting with Sir George
Villiers, it was thought desirable that he should leave Madrid,
he was given a free hand to do so.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
President of the Bible Society (Lord Bexley), with whom Mr
Brandram had consulted, was of the opinion that Borrow should
return home to confer with the Committee.&nbsp; It was clear from
the correspondence that nothing short of an interview could
remove the very obvious feeling of irritation that existed
between Borrow and the Society.&nbsp; In his reply (23rd July),
Borrow showed a dignity and calmness of demeanour that had been
lacking from his previous letters; and it most likely produced a
far more favourable effect at Earl Street than the impassioned
protests of the past two months:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My answer will be very brief;&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;as I am afraid of giving way to my feelings; I
hope, however, that it will be to the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is broadly hinted in yours of the 7th that I have
made false statements in asserting that the Government, in
consequence of what has lately taken place, had come to the
resolution of seizing the Bible dep&ocirc;ts in various parts of
this country.&nbsp; [Borrow had written to Mr Brandram on 25th
June, &ldquo;The Society are already aware of the results of the
visit of our friend to Malaga; all their Bibles and Testaments
having been seized throughout Spain, with the exception of my
stock in Madrid.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reply I beg leave to inform you that by the first
courier you will receive from the British Legation at Madrid the
official notice from Count Ofalia to Sir George Villiers of the
seizures already made, and the motives which induced the
Government to have recourse to such a measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following seizures have already been made, though
some have not as yet been officially announced:&mdash;The
Society&rsquo;s books at Orviedo, Pontevedra, Salamanca,
Santiago, Seville, and Valladolid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears from your letters that the dep&ocirc;ts in
the South of Spain have escaped.&nbsp; I am glad of it, although
it be at my own expense.&nbsp; I see the hand of the Lord
throughout the late transactions.&nbsp; He is chastening me; it
is His pleasure that the guilty escape and the innocent be
punished.&nbsp; The Government gave orders to seize the Bible
dep&ocirc;ts throughout the country on account of the late scenes
at Malaga and Valencia&mdash;I have never been there, yet only
<i>my</i> dep&ocirc;ts are meddled with, as it appears!&nbsp; The
Lord&rsquo;s will be done, blessed be the name of the Lord!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write again to-morrow, I shall have then
arranged my thoughts, and determined on the conduct which it
becomes a Christian to pursue under these circumstances.&nbsp;
Permit me, in conclusion, to ask you:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not to a certain extent been partial in this
matter?&nbsp; Have you not, in the apprehension of being
compelled to blame the conduct of one who has caused me
unutterable anxiety, misery and persecution, and who has been the
bane of the Bible cause in Spain, refused to receive the
information which it was in <i>your</i> power to command?&nbsp; I
called on the Committee and yourself from the first to apply to
Sir George Villiers; no one is so well versed as to what has
lately been going as himself; but no.&nbsp; It was God&rsquo;s
will that I, who have risked all and lost <i>almost</i> all in
the cause, be taunted, suspected, and the sweat of agony and
tears which I have poured out be estimated at the value of the
water of the ditch or the moisture which exudes from rotten dung;
but I murmur not, and hope I shall at all times be willing to bow
to the dispensations of the Almighty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir George Villiers has returned to England for a short
period; you have therefore the opportunity of consulting
him.&nbsp; I <i>will not</i> leave Spain until the whole affair
has been thoroughly sifted.&nbsp; I shall then perhaps appear and
bid you an eternal farewell. <a name="citation273a"></a><a
href="#footnote273a" class="citation">[273a]</a>&nbsp; Four
hundred Testaments have been disposed of in the Sagra of
Toledo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I am just returned from the Embassy,
where I have had a long interview with that admirable person Lord
Wm. Hervey [Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires during Sir George
Villiers&rsquo; absence].&nbsp; He has requested me to write him
a letter on the point in question, which with the official
documents he intends to send to the Secretary of State in order
to be laid before the Bible Society.&nbsp; He has put into my
hands the last communication from Ofalia <a
name="citation273b"></a><a href="#footnote273b"
class="citation">[273b]</a> it relates to the seizure of
<i>my</i> depots at Malaga, Pontevedra, etc.&nbsp; I have not
opened it, but send it for your approval.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is pleasant to record that the Sub-Committee expressed
itself as unable to see in Mr Brandram&rsquo;s letter what Borrow
saw.&nbsp; There was no intention to convey the impression that
he had made false statements, and regret was expressed that he
had thought it necessary to apply to the Embassy for confirmation
of what he had written.&nbsp; All this Mr Brandram conveyed in a
letter dated 6th August.&nbsp; He continues: &ldquo;I am now in
full possession of all that Mr Graydon has done, and find it
utterly impossible to account for that very strong feeling that
you have imbibed against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 20th July Mr Brandram had written that, after consulting
with two or three members of the Committee, they all confirmed a
wish already expressed that their Agent should not continue to
expose himself to such dangers.&nbsp; If, however, he still saw
the way open before him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;as so pleasantly represented in your letter
. . . you need not think of returning . . . Do allow me to
suggest to you,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;to drop allusion to
Mr Graydon in your letters.&nbsp; His conduct is not regarded
here as you regard it.&nbsp; I could fancy, but perhaps it is all
fancy, that you have him in your eye when you tell us that you
have eschewed handbills and advertisements.&nbsp; Time has been
when you have used them plentifully . . .&nbsp; Sir George
Villiers is in England&mdash;but I do not know that we shall seek
an interview with him&mdash;We are afraid of being hampered with
the trammels of office.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Committee, however, did not endorse Mr Brandram&rsquo;s
view as to Borrow continuing in Spain, and further, they did
&ldquo;not see it right,&rdquo; the secretary wrote (6th August),
&ldquo;after the confidential communication in which you have
been in with the Government, that you should be acting now in
such open defiance of it, and putting yourself in such extreme
jeopardy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later Borrow made reference to the remark
about the handbills.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would have been as well,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;if my respected and revered friend, the writer, had
made himself acquainted with the character of my advertisements
before he made that observation.&nbsp; There is no harm in an
advertisement, if truth, decency and the fear of God are
observed, and I believe my own will be scarcely found deficient
in any of these three requisites.&nbsp; It is not the use of a
serviceable instrument, but its abuse that merits reproof, and I
cannot conceive that advertising was abused by me when I informed
the people of Madrid that the New Testament was to be purchased
at a cheap price in the <i>Calle del Principe</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275"
class="citation">[275]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere he referred to these same advertisements as
&ldquo;mild yet expressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the strained state of his relations with the Bible
Society, Borrow had no intention of remaining in Madrid brooding
over his wrongs.&nbsp; Encouraged by the success that had
attended his efforts in the Sagra of Toledo, and indifferent to
the fact that his renewed activity was known at Toledo, where it
was causing some alarm, he determined to proceed to Aranjuez,
and, on his arrival there, to be guided by events as to his
future movements.&nbsp; Accordingly about 28th July he set out
attended by Antonio and Lopez, who had accompanied him from Villa
Seca to Madrid, proceeding in the direction of La Mancha, and
selling at every village through which they passed from twenty to
forty Testaments.&nbsp; At Aranjuez they remained three days,
visiting every house in the town and disposing of about eighty
books.&nbsp; It was no unusual thing to see groups of the poorer
people gathered round one of their number who was reading aloud
from a recently purchased Testament.</p>
<p>Feeling that his enemies were preparing to strike, Borrow
determined to push on to the frontier town of Oca&ntilde;a,
beyond which the clergy had only a nominal jurisdiction on
account of its being in the hands of the Carlists.&nbsp; Lopez
was sent on with between two and three hundred Testaments, and
Borrow, accompanied by Antonio, followed later by a shorter route
through the hills.&nbsp; As they approached the town, a man, a
Jew, stepped out from the porch of an empty house and barred
their way, telling them that Lopez had been arrested at
Oca&ntilde;a that morning as he was selling Testaments in the
streets, and that the authorities were now waiting for Borrow
himself.</p>
<p>Seeing that no good could be done by plunging into the midst
of his enemies, who had their instructions from the
<i>corregidor</i> of Toledo, Borrow decided to return to
Aranjuez.&nbsp; This he did, on the way narrowly escaping
assassination at the hands of three robbers.&nbsp; The next
morning he was rejoined by Lopez, who had been released.&nbsp; He
had sold 27 Testaments, and 200 had been confiscated and
forwarded to Toledo.&nbsp; The whole party then returned to
Madrid.</p>
<p>The unfortunate affair at Oca&ntilde;a by no means discouraged
Borrow.&nbsp; It was his intention &ldquo;with God&rsquo;s
leave&rdquo; to &ldquo;fight it out to the last.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
saw that his only chance of distributing his store of Testaments
lay in visiting the smaller villages before the order to
confiscate his books arrived from Toledo.&nbsp; His enemies were
numerous and watchful; but Borrow was as cunning as a gypsy and
as far-seeing as a Jew.&nbsp; Thinking that his notoriety had not
yet crossed the Guadarrama mountains and penetrated into Old
Castile, he decided to anticipate it.&nbsp; Lopez was sent ahead
with a donkey bearing a cargo of Testaments, his instructions
being to meet Borrow and Antonio at La Granja.&nbsp; Failing to
find Lopez at the appointed place, Borrow pushed on to Segovia,
where he received news that some men were selling books at
Abades, to which place he proceeded with three more donkeys laden
with books that had been consigned to a friend at Segovia.&nbsp;
At Abades Lopez was discovered busily occupied in selling
Testaments.</p>
<p>Hearing that an order was about to be sent from Segovia to
Abades for the confiscation of his Testaments, Borrow immediately
left the town, donkeys, Testaments and all, and for
safety&rsquo;s sake passed the night in the fields.&nbsp; The
next day they proceeded to the village of Labajos.&nbsp; A few
days after their arrival the Carlist leader Balmaceda, at the
head of his robber cavalry, streamed down from the pine woods of
Soria into the southern part of Old Castile, Borrow &ldquo;was
present at all the horrors which ensued&mdash;the sack of
Arrevalo, and the forcible entry into Marrin Mu&ntilde;oz and San
Cyprian.&nbsp; Amidst these terrible scenes we continued our
labours undaunted.&rdquo; <a name="citation277a"></a><a
href="#footnote277a" class="citation">[277a]</a>&nbsp; He
witnessed what &ldquo;was not the war of men or even cannibals .
. . it seemed a contest of fiends from the infernal
pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Antonio became seized with uncontrollable fear
and ran away to Madrid.&nbsp; Lopez soon afterwards disappeared,
and, left alone, Borrow suffered great anxiety as to the fate of
the brave fellow.&nbsp; Hearing that he was in prison at
Vilallos, about three leagues distant, and in spite of the fact
that Balmaceda&rsquo;s cavalry division was in the neighbourhood,
Borrow mounted his horse and set off next day (22nd Aug.)
alone.&nbsp; He found on his arrival at Vilallos, that Lopez had
been removed from the prison to a private house.&nbsp;
Disregarding an order from the <i>corregidor</i> of Avila that
only the books should be confiscated and that the vendor should
be set at liberty, the <i>Alcalde</i>, at the instigation of the
priest, refused to liberate Lopez.&nbsp; It had been hinted to
the unfortunate man that on the arrival of the Carlists he was to
be denounced as a liberal, which would mean death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Taking these circumstances into consideration,&rdquo;
Borrow wrote, <a name="citation277b"></a><a href="#footnote277b"
class="citation">[277b]</a> &ldquo;I deemed it my duty as a
Christian and a gentleman to rescue my unfortunate servant from
such lawless hands, and in consequence, defying opposition, I
bore him off, though perfectly unarmed, through a crowd of at
least one hundred peasants.&nbsp; On leaving the place I shouted
&lsquo;Viva Isabella Segunda.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this affair Borrow had, not only the approval of Lord
William Hervey, but of Count Ofalia also.&nbsp; In all
probability the Bible Society has never had, and never will have
again, an agent such as Borrow, who on occasion could throw aside
the cloak of humility and grasp a two-edged sword with which to
discomfit his enemies, and who solemnly chanted the creed of
Islam whilst engaged as a Christian missionary.&nbsp; There was
something magnificent in his Christianity; it savoured of the
Crusades in its pre-Reformation virility.&nbsp; Martyrdom he
would accept if absolutely necessary; but he preferred that if
martyrs there must be they should be selected from the ranks of
the enemy, whilst he, George Borrow, represented the strong arm
of the Lord.</p>
<p>After the Vilallos affair, Borrow returned to Madrid, crossing
the Guadarramas alone and with two horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;I nearly
perished there,&rdquo; he wrote to Mr Brandram (1st Sept.),
&ldquo;having lost my way in the darkness and tumbled down a
precipice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The perilous journey north had resulted
in the sale of 900 Testaments, all within the space of three
weeks and amidst scenes of battle and bloodshed.</p>
<p>On his return to Madrid, Borrow found awaiting him the
Resolution of the General Committee (6th Aug.), recalling him
&ldquo;without further delay.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will set out for England as soon as
possible,&rdquo; he wrote in reply; <a name="citation278"></a><a
href="#footnote278" class="citation">[278]</a> &ldquo;but I must
be allowed time.&nbsp; I am almost dead with fatigue, suffering
and anxiety; and it is necessary that I should place the
Society&rsquo;s property in safe and sure custody.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 1st September he wrote to Mr Brandram that he should
&ldquo;probably be in England within three weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Shortly after this he was attacked with fever, and confined to
his bed for ten days, during which he was frequently
delirious.&nbsp; When the fever departed, he was left very weak
and subject to a profound melancholy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I bore up against my illness as long as I
could,&rdquo; he wrote, <a name="citation279a"></a><a
href="#footnote279a" class="citation">[279a]</a> &ldquo;but it
became too powerful for me.&nbsp; By good fortune I obtained a
decent physician, a Dr Hacayo, who had studied medicine in
England, and aided by him and the strength of my constitution I
got the better of my attack, which, however, was a dreadfully
severe one.&nbsp; I hope my next letter will be from
Bordeaux.&nbsp; I cannot write more at present, for I am very
feeble.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual date that Borrow left Madrid is not known.&nbsp; He
himself gave it as 31st August, <a name="citation279b"></a><a
href="#footnote279b" class="citation">[279b]</a> which is
obviously inaccurate, as on 19th September he wrote to Mr
Brandram: &ldquo;I am now better, and hope in a few days to be
able to proceed to Saragossa, which is the only road
open.&rdquo;&nbsp; He travelled leisurely by way of the Pyrenees,
through France to Paris, where he spent a fortnight.&nbsp; Of
Paris he was very fond; &ldquo;for, leaving all prejudices aside,
it is a magnificent city, well supplied with sumptuous buildings
and public squares, unequalled by any town in Europe.&rdquo; <a
name="citation279c"></a><a href="#footnote279c"
class="citation">[279c]</a>&nbsp; Having bought a few rare books
he proceeded to Boulogne, &ldquo;and thence by steamboat to
London,&rdquo; <a name="citation279d"></a><a href="#footnote279d"
class="citation">[279d]</a> where in all probability he arrived
towards the end of October.</p>
<p>He had &ldquo;long talks on Spanish affairs&rdquo; <a
name="citation279e"></a><a href="#footnote279e"
class="citation">[279e]</a> with his friends at Earl Street,
where personal interviews seem to have brought about a much
better feeling.&nbsp; The General Committee requested Borrow to
put into writing his views as to the best means to be adopted for
the future distribution of the Scriptures in Spain.&nbsp; He
accordingly wrote a statement, <a name="citation280"></a><a
href="#footnote280" class="citation">[280]</a> a fine, vigorous
piece of narrative, putting his case so clearly and convincingly
as to leave little to be said for the unfortunate Graydon.&nbsp;
He expressed himself as &ldquo;eager to be carefully and
categorically questioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Report appears
subsequently to have been withdrawn, probably on the advice of
Borrow&rsquo;s friends, who saw that its uncompromising bluntness
of expression would make it unacceptable to the General
Committee.&nbsp; It was certainly presented to and considered by
the Sub-Committee.&nbsp; Another document was drawn up entitled,
&ldquo;Report of Mr Geo. Borrow on Past and Future Operations in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; This reached Earl Street on 28th
November.&nbsp; In it Borrow states that as the inhabitants of
the cities had not shown themselves well-disposed towards the
Scriptures, it would be better to labour in future among the
peasantry.&nbsp; It was his firm conviction, he wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that every village in Spain will purchase
New Testaments, from twenty to sixty, according to its
circumstances.&nbsp; During the last two months of his sojourn in
Spain he visited about forty villages, and in only two instances
was his sale less than thirty copies in each . . . If it be
objected to the plan which he has presumed to suggest that it is
impossible to convey to the rural districts of Spain the book of
life without much difficulty and danger, he begs leave to observe
that it does not become a real Christian to be daunted by either
when it pleases his Maker to select him as an instrument; and
that, moreover, if it be not written that a man is to perish by
wild beasts or reptiles he is safe in the den even of the
Cockatrice as in the most retired chamber of the King&rsquo;s
Palace; and that if, on the contrary, he be doomed to perish by
them, his destiny will overtake him notwithstanding all the
precautions which he, like a blind worm, may essay for his
security.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion Borrow calls attention, without suggesting
intimate alliance and co-operation, to the society of the
liberal-minded Spanish ecclesiastics, which has been formed for
the purpose of printing and circulating the Scriptures in Spanish
<i>without commentary or notes</i>.&nbsp; This had reference to a
movement that was on foot in Madrid, supported by the Primate and
the Bishops of Vigo and Joen, to challenge the Government in
regard to its attempt to prevent the free circulation of the
Scriptures.&nbsp; It was held that nowhere among the laws of
Spain is it forbidden to circulate the Scriptures either with or
without annotations.&nbsp; The only prohibition being in the
various Papal Bulls.&nbsp; Charles Wood was chosen as &ldquo;the
ostensible manager of the concern&rdquo;; but had it not been for
the trouble in the South, Borrow would have been the person
selected.</p>
<p>It would have been in every way deplorable had Borrow severed
his connection with the Bible Society as a result of the Graydon
episode.&nbsp; Borrow had been impulsive and indignant in his
letters to Earl Street, Mr Brandram, on the other hand, had been
&ldquo;a little partial,&rdquo; and on one or two occasions must
have written hastily in response to Borrow&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp;
There is no object in administering blame or directing reproaches
when the principals in a quarrel have made up their differences;
but there can be no question that the failure of the Officials
and Committee of the Bible Society to appreciate the situation in
Spain retarded their work in that country very
considerably.&nbsp; This fact is now generally recognised.&nbsp;
Mr Canton has admirably summed up the situation when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Borrow had his faults, but insincerity and
lack of zeal in the cause he had espoused were not among
them.&nbsp; Both Sir George Villiers and his successor [during
Sir George&rsquo;s visit to England], Lord William Hervey, were
satisfied with the propriety of his conduct.&nbsp; Count Ofalia
himself recognised his good faith&mdash;&lsquo;<i>cuia buena
f&eacute; me es conocida</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; To see his plans
thwarted, his work arrested, the objects of the Society
jeopardised, and his own person endangered by the indiscretion of
others, formed, if not a justification, at least a sufficient
excuse for the expression of strong feeling.&nbsp; On the other
hand, it was difficult for those at home to ascertain the actual
facts of the case, to understand the nicety of the situation, and
to arrive at an impartial judgment.&nbsp; Mr Brandram, who in any
case would have been displeased with Borrow&rsquo;s unrestrained
speech, appears to have suspected that his statements were not
free from exaggeration, and that his discretion was not wholly
beyond reproach.&nbsp; Happily the tension caused by this painful
episode was relieved by Lieut. Graydon&rsquo;s withdrawal to
France in June.&rdquo; <a name="citation282"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> 14th December 1838 it was
resolved by the General Committee of the Bible Society that
Borrow should proceed once more to Spain to dispose of such
copies of the Scriptures as remained on hand at Madrid and other
dep&ocirc;ts established by him in various parts of the
country.&nbsp; He left London on the 21st, and sailed from
Falmouth two days later, reaching Cadiz on the 31st, after a
stormy passage, and on 2nd January he arrived at Seville,
&ldquo;rather indisposed with an old complaint,&rdquo; probably
&ldquo;the Horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such stirring times to be absent from the country, even for
so short a period as two months, meant that on his return the
traveller found a new Spain.&nbsp; Borrow learned that the Duke
of Frias had succeeded Count Ofalia in September.&nbsp; The Duke
had advised the British Ambassador in November that the Spanish
authorities were possessed of a quantity of Borrow&rsquo;s Bibles
(?New Testaments) that had been seized and taken to Toledo, and
that if arrangements were not made for them to be taken out of
Spain they would be destroyed.&nbsp; Sir George Villiers had
replied that Mr Borrow, who was then out of the country, had been
advised of the Duke&rsquo;s notification, and as soon as word was
received from him, the Duke should be communicated with.&nbsp;
Then the Duke of Frias in turn passed out of office and was
succeeded by another, and so, politically, change followed
change.</p>
<p>The Government, however, had no intention of putting itself in
the wrong a second time.&nbsp; Great Britain&rsquo;s friendship
was of far too great importance to the country to be jeopardised
for the mere gratification of imprisoning George Borrow.&nbsp; An
order had been sent out to all the authorities that an embargo
was to be placed upon the books themselves; but those
distributing them were not to be arrested or in any way
harmed.</p>
<p>At Seville he found evidences of the activity of the
Government in the news that of the hundred New Testaments that he
had left with his correspondent there, seventy-six had been
seized during the previous summer.&nbsp; Hearing that the books
were in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Governor, Borrow
astonished that &ldquo;fierce, persecuting Papist by calling to
make enquiries concerning them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man treated
his visitor to a stream of impassioned invective against the
Bible Society and its agent, expressing his surprise that he had
ever been permitted to leave the prison in Madrid.&nbsp; Seeing
that nothing was to be gained, although he had an absolute right
to the books, provided he sent them out of the country, Borrow
decided not to press the matter.</p>
<p>On the night of 12th Jan. 1839, he left Seville with the Mail
Courier and his escort bound for Madrid, where he arrived on the
16th without accident or incident, although the next Courier
traversing the route was stopped by banditti.&nbsp; It was during
this journey, whilst resting for four hours at Manzanares, a
large village in La Mancha, that he encountered the blind girl
who had been taught Latin by a Jesuit priest, and whom he named
&ldquo;the Manchegan Prophetess.&rdquo; <a
name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a>&nbsp; In telling Mr Brandram of the
incident, Borrow tactlessly remarked, &ldquo;what wonderful
people are the Jesuits; when shall we hear of an English rector
instructing a beggar girl in the language of Cicero?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr Brandram clearly showed that he liked neither the remark,
which he took as personal, nor the use of the term
&ldquo;prophetess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching Madrid a singular incident befell Borrow.&nbsp; On
entering the arch of the <i>posada</i> called La Reyna, he found
himself encircled by a pair of arms, and, on turning round, found
that they belonged to the delinquent Antonio, who stood before
his late master &ldquo;haggard and ill-dressed, and his eyes
seemed starting from their sockets.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor fellow,
who was entirely destitute, had, on the previous night, dreamed
that he saw Borrow arrive on a black horse, and, in consequence,
had spent the whole day in loitering about outside the
<i>posada</i>.&nbsp; Borrow was very glad to engage him again, in
spite of his recent cowardice and desertion.&nbsp; Borrow once
more took up his abode with the estimable Maria Diaz, and one of
his first cares was to call on Lord Clarendon (Sir George
Villiers had succeeded his uncle as fourth earl), by whom he was
kindly received.</p>
<p>A week later, there arrived from Lopez at Villa Seca his
&ldquo;largest and most useful horse,&rdquo; the famous Sidi
Habismilk (My Lord the Sustainer of the Kingdom), &ldquo;an
Arabian of high caste . . . the best, I believe, that ever issued
from the desert,&rdquo; <a name="citation285a"></a><a
href="#footnote285a" class="citation">[285a]</a> Lopez wrote,
regretting that he was unable to accompany &ldquo;The Sustainer
of the Kingdom&rdquo; in person, being occupied with agricultural
pursuits, but he sent a relative named Victoriano to assist in
the work of distributing the Gospel.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s plan was to make Madrid his headquarters, with
Antonio in charge of the supplies, and visit all the villages and
hamlets in the vicinity that had not yet been supplied with
Testaments.&nbsp; He then proposed to turn eastward to a distance
of about thirty leagues.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been very passionate in
prayer,&rdquo; he writes, <a name="citation285b"></a><a
href="#footnote285b" class="citation">[285b]</a> &ldquo;during
the last two or three days; and I entertain some hope that the
Lord has condescended to answer me, as I appear to see my way
with considerable clearness.&nbsp; It may, of course, prove a
delusion, and the prospects which seem to present themselves may
be mere palaces of clouds, which a breath of wind is sufficient
to tumble into ruin; therefore bearing this possibility in mind
it behoves me to beg that I may be always enabled to bow meekly
to the dispensations of the Almighty, whether they be of favour
or severity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Brandram&rsquo;s comment on this portion of Borrow&rsquo;s
letter is rather suggestive of deliberate fault-finding.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May your &lsquo;passionate&rsquo; prayers
be answered,&rdquo; he writes. <a name="citation286"></a><a
href="#footnote286" class="citation">[286]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see I remark your unusual word&mdash;very significant it is, but
one rather fitted for the select circle where
&lsquo;passion&rsquo; is understood in its own full
sense&mdash;and not in the restricted meaning attached to it
ordinarily.&nbsp; Perhaps you will not often meet with a better
set of men than those who assembled in Earl Street, but they may
not always be open to the force of language, and so unwonted a
phrase may raise odd feelings in their minds.&nbsp; Do not be in
a passion, will you, for the freedom of my remarks.&nbsp; You
will perhaps suppose remarks were made in Committee.&nbsp; This
does not happen to be the case, though I fully anticipated
it.&nbsp; Mr Browne, Mr Jowett and myself had first privately
devoured your letter, and we made our remarks.&nbsp; We could
relish such a phrase.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes there was a suggestion of spite in Mr
Brandram&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; He was obviously unfriendly
towards Borrow during the latter portion of his agency.&nbsp; It
was clear that the period of Borrow&rsquo;s further association
with the Bible Society was to be limited.&nbsp; If he replied at
all to this rather unfair criticism, he must have done so
privately to Mr Brandram, as there is no record of his having
referred to it in any subsequent letters among the
Society&rsquo;s archives.</p>
<p>All unconscious that he had so early offended, Borrow set out
upon his first journey to distribute Testaments among the
villages around Madrid.&nbsp; Dressed in the manner of the
peasants, on his head a <i>montera</i>, a species of leathern
helmet, with jacket and trousers of the same material, and
mounted on Sidi Habismilk, he looked so unlike the conventional
missionary that the housewife may be excused who mistook him for
a pedlar selling soap.</p>
<p>In some villages where the people were without money, they
received Testaments in return for refreshing the
missionaries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo; Borrow enquires
of Mr Brandram.&nbsp; The village priests frequently proved of
considerable assistance; for when they pronounced the books good,
as they sometimes did, the sale became extremely brisk.&nbsp;
After an absence of eight days, Borrow returned to Madrid.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards, when on the eve of starting out upon another
expedition to Guadalajara and the villages of Alcarria, he
received a letter from Victoriano saying that he was in prison at
Fuente la Higuera, a village about eight leagues distant.&nbsp;
Acting with his customary energy and decision, Borrow obtained
from an influential friend letters to the Civil Governor and
principal authorities of Guadalajara.&nbsp; He then despatched
Antonio to the rescue, with the result that Victoriano was
released, with the assurance that those responsible for his
detention should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Whilst Victoriano was in prison, Borrow and Antonio had been
very successful in selling Testaments and Bibles in Madrid,
disposing of upwards of a hundred copies, but entirely to the
poor, who &ldquo;receive the Scriptures with gladness,&rdquo;
although the hearts of the rich were hard.&nbsp; The work in and
about Madrid continued until the middle of March, when Borrow
decided to make an excursion as far as Talavera.&nbsp; The first
halt was made at the village of Naval Carnero.&nbsp; Soon after
his arrival orders came from Madrid warning the <i>alcaldes</i>
of every village in New Castile to be on the look out for the
tall, white-haired heretic, of whom an exact description was
given, who to-day was in one place and to-morrow twenty leagues
distant.&nbsp; No violence was to be offered either to him or to
his assistants; but he and they were to be baulked in their
purpose by every legitimate means.</p>
<p>Foiled in the rural districts, Borrow instantly determined to
change his plan of campaign.&nbsp; He saw that he was less likely
to attract notice in the densely-populated capital than in the
provinces.&nbsp; He therefore galloped back to Madrid, leaving
Victoriano to follow more leisurely.&nbsp; He rejoiced at the
alarm of the clergy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; he
exclaims, &ldquo;they are becoming thoroughly alarmed, and with
much reason.&rdquo; <a name="citation288a"></a><a
href="#footnote288a" class="citation">[288a]</a>&nbsp; The
&ldquo;reason&rdquo; lay in the great demand for Testaments and
Bibles.&nbsp; A new binding-order had to be given for the balance
of the 500 Bibles that had arrived in sheets, or such as had been
left of them by the rats, who had done considerable damage in the
Madrid storehouse.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Borrow&rsquo;s extensive
acquaintance with the lower orders proved useful.&nbsp; Selecting
eight of the most intelligent from among them, including five
women, he supplied them with Testaments and instructions to vend
the books in all the parishes of Madrid, with the result that in
the course of about a fortnight 600 copies were disposed of in
the streets and alleys.&nbsp; A house to house canvass was
instituted with remarkable results, for manservant and
maidservant bought eagerly of the books.&nbsp; Antonio excelled
himself and made some amends for his flight from Labajos, when,
like a torrent, the Carlist cavalry descended upon it.&nbsp; Dark
Madrid was becoming illuminated with a flood of Scriptural
light.&nbsp; In two of its churches the New Testament was
expounded every Sunday evening.&nbsp; Bibles were particularly in
demand, a hundred being sold in about three weeks.&nbsp; The
demand exceeded the supply.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Marques de Santa
Coloma,&rdquo; Borrow wrote, &ldquo;has a large family, but every
individual of it, old or young, is now in possession of a Bible
and likewise of a Testament.&rdquo; <a name="citation288b"></a><a
href="#footnote288b" class="citation">[288b]</a></p>
<p>Borrow appears to have enlisted the aid of other distributors
than the eight colporteurs.&nbsp; One of his most zealous agents
was an ecclesiastic, who always carried with him beneath his gown
a copy of the Bible, which he offered to the first person he
encountered whom he thought likely to become a purchaser.&nbsp;
Yet another assistant was found in a rich old gentleman of
Navarre, who sent copies to his own province.</p>
<p>One night after having retired to bed, Borrow received a visit
from a curious, hobgoblin-like person, who gave him grave,
official warning that unless he present himself before the
<i>corregidor</i> on the morrow at eleven <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, he must be prepared to take the
consequences.&nbsp; The hour chosen for this intimation was
midnight.&nbsp; On the next day at the appointed time Borrow
presented himself before the <i>corregidor</i>, who announced
that he wished to ask a question.&nbsp; The question related to a
box of Testaments that Borrow had sent to Naval Carnero, which
had been seized and subsequently claimed on Borrow&rsquo;s behalf
by Antonio.&nbsp; In Spain they have the dramatic instinct.&nbsp;
If it strike the majestic mind of a <i>corregidor</i> at midnight
that he would like to see a citizen or a stranger on the morrow
about some trifling affair, time or place are not permitted to
interfere with the conveyance of the intimation to the citizen or
stranger to present himself before the gravely austere official,
who will carry out the interrogation with a solemnity becoming a
capital charge.</p>
<p>By the middle of April barely a thousand Testaments remained;
these Borrow determined to distribute in Seville.&nbsp; Sending
Antonio, the Testaments and two horses with the convoy, Borrow
decided to risk travelling with the Mail Courier.&nbsp; For one
thing, he disliked the slowness of a convoy, and for another the
insults and irritations that travellers had to put up with from
the escort, both officers and men.&nbsp; His original plan had
been to proceed by Estremadura; but a band of Carlist robbers had
recently made its appearance, murdering or holding at ransom
every person who fell into its clutches.&nbsp; Borrow
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I therefore deem it wise to avoid, if
possible, the alternative of being shot or having to pay one
thousand pounds for being set at liberty . . . It is moreover
wicked to tempt Providence systematically.&nbsp; I have already
thrust myself into more danger than was, perhaps, strictly
necessary, and as I have been permitted hitherto to escape, it is
better to be content with what it has pleased the Lord to do for
me up to the present moment, than to run the risk of offending
Him by a blind confidence in His forbearance, which may be
over-taxed.&nbsp; As it is, however, at all times best to be
frank, I am willing to confess that I am what the world calls
exceedingly superstitious; perhaps the real cause of my change of
resolution was a dream, in which I imagined myself on a desolate
road in the hands of several robbers, who were hacking me with
their long, ugly knives.&rdquo; <a name="citation290"></a><a
href="#footnote290" class="citation">[290]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same letter, which was so to incur Mr Brandram&rsquo;s
disapproval, Borrow tells of the excellent results of his latest
plan for disposing of Bibles and Testaments, three hundred and
fifty of the former having been sold since he reached
Spain.&nbsp; He goes on to explain and expound the difficulties
that have been met and overcome, and hopes that his friends at
Earl Street will be patient, as it may not be in his power to
send &ldquo;for a long time any flattering accounts of operations
commenced there.&rdquo;&nbsp; In conclusion, he assures Mr
Brandram that from the Church of Rome he has learned one thing,
&ldquo;<i>Ever to expect evil</i>, <i>and ever to hope for
good</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more unfortunate than the effect
produced upon Mr Brandram&rsquo;s mind by this letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what to say,&rdquo; he
writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in a very peculiar country; you are
doubtless a man of very peculiar temperament, and we must not
apply common rules in judging either of yourself or your
affairs.&nbsp; What, <i>e.g.</i>, shall we say to your confession
of a certain superstitiousness?&nbsp; It is very frank of you to
tell us what you need not have told; but it sounded very odd when
read aloud in a large Committee.&nbsp; Strangers that know you
not would carry away strange ideas . . . In bespeaking our
patience, there is an implied contrast between your own mode of
proceeding and that adopted by others&mdash;a contrast this a
little to the disadvantage of others, and savouring a little of
the praise of a personage called number one . . . Perhaps my
vanity is offended, and I feel as if I were not esteemed a person
of sufficient discernment to know enough of the real state of
Spain . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear with me now in my criticisms on your second letter
[that of 2nd May].&nbsp; You narrate your perilous journey to
Seville, and say at the beginning of the description: &lsquo;My
usual wonderful good fortune accompanying us.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
is a mode of speaking to which we are not well accustomed; it
savours, some of our friends would say, a little of the
profane.&nbsp; Those who know you will not impute this to
you.&nbsp; But you must remember that our Committee Room is
public to a great extent, and I cannot omit expressions as I go
reading on.&nbsp; Pious sentiments may be thrust into letters
<i>ad nauseam</i>, and it is not for that I plead; but is there
not a <i>via media</i>?&nbsp; &ldquo;We are odd people, it may
be, in England; we are not fond of prophets or
&lsquo;prophetesses&rsquo; [a reference to her of La Mancha about
whom Borrow had previously been rebuked].&nbsp; I have not turned
back to your former description of the lady whom you have a
second time introduced to our notice.&nbsp; Perhaps my wounded
pride had not been made whole after the infliction you before
gave it by contrasting the teacher of the prophetess with English
rectors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow replied to this letter from Seville on 28th June, and
there are indications that before doing so he took time to
deliberate upon it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Think not, I pray you,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;that any observation of yours respecting style, or any
peculiarities of expression which I am in the habit of exhibiting
in my correspondence, can possibly awaken in me any feeling but
that of gratitude, knowing so well as I do the person who offers
them, and the motives by which he is influenced.&nbsp; I have
reflected on those passages which you were pleased to point out
as objectionable, and have nothing to reply further than that I
have erred, that I am sorry, and will endeavour to mend, and
that, moreover, I have already prayed for assistance to do
so.&nbsp; Allow me, however, to offer a word, not in excuse but
in explanation of the expression &lsquo;wonderful good
fortune&rsquo; which appeared in a former letter of mine.&nbsp;
It is clearly objectionable, and, as you very properly observe,
savours of pagan times.&nbsp; But I am sorry to say that I am
much in the habit of repeating other people&rsquo;s sayings
without weighing their propriety.&nbsp; The saying was not mine;
but I heard it in conversation and thoughtlessly repeated
it.&nbsp; A few miles from Seville I was telling the Courier of
the many perilous journeys which I had accomplished in Spain in
safety, and for which I thank the Lord.&nbsp; His reply was,
&lsquo;La mucha suerte de Usted tambien nos ha acompa&ntilde;ado
en este viage.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus ended another unfortunate misunderstanding between
secretary and agent.</p>
<p>Borrow had taken considerable risk in making the journey to
Seville with the Courier.&nbsp; The whole of La Mancha was
overrun with the Carlist-banditti, who, &ldquo;whenever it
pleases them, stop the Courier, burn the vehicle and letters,
murder the paltry escort which attends, and carry away any chance
passenger to the mountains, where an enormous ransom is demanded,
which if not paid brings on the dilemma of four shots through the
head, as the Spaniards say.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Courier&rsquo;s
previous journey over the same route had ended in the murder of
the escort and the burning of the coach, the Courier himself
escaping through the good offices of one of the bandits, who had
formerly been his postilion.&nbsp; Borrow was shown the
blood-soaked turf and the skull of one of the soldiers.&nbsp; At
Manzanares, Borrow invited to breakfast with him the Prophetess
who was so unpopular at Earl Street.&nbsp; Continuing the
journey, he reached Seville without mishap, and a few days later
Antonio arrived with the horses.&nbsp; It was found that the two
cases of Testaments that had been forwarded from Madrid had been
stopped at the Seville Customs House, and Borrow had recourse to
subterfuge in order to get them and save his journey from being
in vain.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For a few dollars,&rdquo; he tells Mr
Brandram (2nd May), &ldquo;I procured a <i>fiador</i> or person
who engaged <i>that the chests</i> should be carried down the
river and embarked at San Lucar for a foreign land.&nbsp;
Yesterday I hired a boat and sent them down, but on the way I
landed in a secure place all the Testaments which I intend for
this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>fiador</i> had kept to the letter of his undertaking,
and the chests were duly delivered at San Lucar; but a
considerable portion of their contents, some two hundred
Testaments, had been abstracted, and these had to be smuggled
into Seville under the cloaks of master and servant.&nbsp; The
officials appear to have treated Borrow with the greatest
possible courtesy and consideration, and they told him that his
&ldquo;intentions were known and honored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had great hopes of achieving something for the
Gospel&rsquo;s sake in Seville; but the operation would be a
delicate one.&nbsp; To Mr Brandram he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Consider my situation here.&nbsp; I am in a
city by nature very Levitical, as it contains within it the most
magnificent and splendidly endowed cathedral of any in
Spain.&nbsp; I am surrounded by priests and friars, who know and
hate me, and who, if I commit the slightest act of indiscretion,
will halloo their myrmidons against me.&nbsp; The press is closed
to me, the libraries are barred against me, I have no one to
assist me but my hired servant, no pious English families to
comfort or encourage me, the British subjects here being ranker
papists and a hundred times more bigoted than the Spanish
themselves, the Consul, a <i>renegade Quaker</i>.&nbsp; Yet
notwithstanding, with God&rsquo;s assistance, I will do much,
though silently, burrowing like the mole in darkness beneath the
ground.&nbsp; Those who have triumphed in Madrid, and in the two
Castiles, where the difficulties were seven times greater, are
not to be dismayed by priestly frowns at Seville.&rdquo; <a
name="citation293"></a><a href="#footnote293"
class="citation">[293]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On arriving at Seville Borrow had put up at the <i>Posada de
la Reyna</i>, in the Calle Gimios, and here on 4th May (he had
arrived about 24th April) he encountered Lieut.-Colonel Elers
Napier.&nbsp; Borrow liked nothing so well as appearing in the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a mysterious stranger.&nbsp; He loved
mystery as much as a dramatic moment.&nbsp; His admiration of
Baron Taylor was largely based upon the innumerable conjectures
as to who it was that surrounded his puzzling personality with
such an air of mystery.&nbsp; That May morning Colonel Napier,
who was also staying at the <i>Posada de la Reyna</i>, was
wandering about the galleries overlooking the <i>patio</i>.&nbsp;
He writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;whilst occupied in moralising over the
dripping water spouts, I observed a tall, gentlemanly-looking man
dressed in a <i>semarra</i> [<i>zamarra</i>, a sheepskin jacket
with the wool outside] leaning over the balustrades and
apparently engaged in a similar manner with myself . . .&nbsp;
From the stranger&rsquo;s complexion, which was fair, but with
brilliant black eyes, I concluded he was not a Spaniard; in
short, there was something so remarkable in his appearance that
it was difficult to say to what nation he might belong.&nbsp; He
was tall, with a commanding appearance; yet, though apparently in
the flower of manhood, his hair was so deeply tinged with the
winter of either age or sorrow as to be nearly snow white.&rdquo;
<a name="citation294a"></a><a href="#footnote294a"
class="citation">[294a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Napier was thoroughly mystified.&nbsp; The stranger
answered his French in &ldquo;the purest Parisian Accent&rdquo;;
yet he proved capable of speaking fluent English, of giving
orders to his Greek servant in Roma&iuml;c, of conversing
&ldquo;in good Castillian with &lsquo;mine host&rsquo;,&rdquo;
and of exchanging salutations in German with another resident at
the <i>fonda</i>.&nbsp; Later the Colonel had the gratification
of startling the Unknown by replying to some remark of his in
Hindi; but only momentarily, for he showed himself
&ldquo;delighted on finding I was an Indian, and entered freely,
and with depth and acuteness, on the affairs of the East, most of
which part of the world he had visited.&rdquo; <a
name="citation294b"></a><a href="#footnote294b"
class="citation">[294b]</a></p>
<p>No one could give any information about &ldquo;the mysterious
Unknown,&rdquo; who or what he was, or why he was
travelling.&nbsp; It was known that the police entertained
suspicions that he was a Russian spy, and kept him under strict
observation.&nbsp; Whatever else he was, Colonel Napier found him
&ldquo;a very agreeable companion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation295"></a><a href="#footnote295"
class="citation">[295]</a></p>
<p>On the following morning (a Sunday) Colonel Napier and his
Unknown set out on horseback on an excursion to the ruins of
Italica.&nbsp; As they sat on a ruined wall of the Convent of San
Isidoro, contemplating the scene of ruin and desolation around,
&ldquo;the &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; began to feel the vein of poetry
creeping through his inward soul, and gave vent to it by reciting
with great emphasis and effect&rdquo; some lines that the scene
called up to his mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I had been too much taken up with the
scene,&rdquo; Colonel Napier continues, &ldquo;the verses, and
the strange being who was repeating them with so much feeling, to
notice the approach of a slight female figure, beautiful in the
extreme, but whose tattered garments, raven hair, swarthy
complexion and flashing eyes proclaimed to be of the wandering
tribe of <i>Gitanos</i>.&nbsp; From an intuitive sense of
politeness, she stood with crossed arms and a slight smile on her
dark and handsome countenance until my companion had ceased, and
then addressed us in the usual whining tone of
supplication&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Caballeritos</i>, <i>una
limosnita</i>!&nbsp; <i>Dios se la pagar&aacute; &aacute;
ustedes</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Gentlemen, a little charity; God
will repay it to you!&rsquo;&nbsp; The gypsy girl was so pretty
and her voice so sweet, that I involuntarily put my hand in my
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said the Unknown.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
you remember what I told you about the Eastern origin of these
people?&nbsp; You shall see I am
correct.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Come here, my pretty child,&rsquo;
said he in Moultanee, &lsquo;and tell me where are the rest of
your tribe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl looked astounded, replied in the same tongue,
but in broken language; when, taking him by the arm, she said in
Spanish, &lsquo;Come, cabellero&mdash;come to one who will be
able to answer you&rsquo;; and she led the way down amongst the
ruins, towards one of the dens formerly occupied by the wild
beasts, and disclosed to us a set of beings scarcely less
savage.&nbsp; The sombre walls of the gloomy abode were illumined
by a fire the smoke from which escaped through a deep fissure in
the mossy roof; whilst the flickering flames threw a blood-red
glare on the bronzed features of a group of children, of two men,
and a decrepit old hag, who appeared busily engaged in some
culinary preparations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our entrance, the scowling glance of the males of
the party, and a quick motion of the hand towards the folds of
the &lsquo;faja&rsquo; [a sash in which the Spaniard carries a
formidable clasp-knife] caused in me, at least, anything but a
comfortable sensation; but their hostile intentions, if ever
entertained, were immediately removed by a wave of the hand from
our conductress, who, leading my companion towards the sibyl,
whispered something in her ear.&nbsp; The old crone appeared
incredulous.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; uttered one word;
but that word had the effect of magic; she prostrated herself at
his feet, and in an instant, from an object of suspicion he
became one of worship to the whole family, to whom, on taking
leave, he made a handsome present, and departed with their united
blessings, to the astonishment of myself and what looked very
like terror in our Spanish guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, as the phrase goes, dying with curiosity, and as
soon as we mounted our horses, exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Where, in
the name of goodness, did you pick up your acquaintance with the
language of those extraordinary people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some years ago, in Moultan,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And by what means do you possess such apparent
influence over them?&rsquo;&nbsp; But the &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo;
had already said more than he perhaps wished on the
subject.&nbsp; He drily replied that he had more than once owed
his life to gypsies, and had reason to know them well; but this
was said in a tone which precluded all further queries on my
part.&nbsp; The subject was never again broached, and we returned
in silence to the fonda . . .&nbsp; This is a most extraordinary
character, and the more I see of him the more am I puzzled.&nbsp;
He appears acquainted with everybody and everything, but
apparently unknown to every one himself.&nbsp; Though his figure
bespeaks youth&mdash;and by his own account his age does not
exceed thirty [he would be thirty-six in the following
July]&mdash;yet the snows of eighty winters could not have
whitened his locks more completely than they are.&nbsp; But in
his dark and searching eye there is an almost supernatural
penetration and lustre, which, were I inclined to superstition,
might induce me to set down its possessor as a second
Melmoth.&rdquo; <a name="citation297"></a><a href="#footnote297"

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
MAY&ndash;DECEMBER 1839</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> confesses that he was at a
loss to know how to commence operations in Seville.&nbsp; He was
entirely friendless, even the British Consul being unapproachable
on account of his religious beliefs.&nbsp; However, he soon
gathered round him some of those curious characters who seemed
always to gravitate towards him, no matter where he might be, or
with what occupied.&nbsp; Surely the Scriptures never had such a
curious assortment of missionaries as Borrow employed?&nbsp; At
Seville there was the gigantic Greek, Dionysius of Cephalonia;
the &ldquo;aged professor of music, who, with much stiffness and
ceremoniousness, united much that was excellent and
admirable&rdquo;; <a name="citation298"></a><a
href="#footnote298" class="citation">[298]</a> the Greek
bricklayer, Johannes Chysostom, a native of Morea, who might at
any time become &ldquo;the Masaniello of Seville.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With these assistants Borrow set to work to throw the light of
the Gospel into the dark corners of the city.</p>
<p>Soon after arriving at Seville, he decided to adopt a new plan
of living.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On account of the extreme dearness of every
article at the <i>posada</i>,&rdquo; he wrote to Mr Brandram on
12th June, &ldquo;where, moreover, I had a suspicion that I was
being watched [this may have reference to the police suspicion
that he was a Russian spy], I removed with my servant and horses
to an empty house in a solitary part of the town . . .&nbsp; Here
I live in the greatest privacy, admitting no person but two or
three in whom I had the greatest confidence, who entertain the
same views as myself, and who assist me in the circulation of the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house stood in a solitary situation, occupying one side of
the Plazuela de la Pila Seca (the Little Square of the Empty
Trough).&nbsp; It was a two-storied building and much too large
for Borrow&rsquo;s requirements.&nbsp; Having bought the
necessary articles of furniture, he retired behind the shutters
of his Andalusian mansion with Antonio and the two horses.&nbsp;
He lived in the utmost seclusion, spending a large portion of his
time in study or in dreamy meditation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people
here complain sadly of the heat,&rdquo; he writes to Mr Brandram
(28th June 1839), &ldquo;but as for myself, I luxuriate in it,
like the butterflies which hover about the <i>macetas</i>, or
flowerpots, in the court.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the cool of the evening
he would mount Sidi Habismilk and ride along the <i>Dehesa</i>
until the topmost towers of the city were out of sight, then,
turning the noble Arab, he would let him return at his best
speed, which was that of the whirlwind.</p>
<p>Throughout his work in Spain Borrow had been seriously
handicapped by being unable to satisfy the demand for Bibles that
met him everywhere he went.&nbsp; In a letter (June) from Maria
Diaz, who was acting as his agent in Madrid, <a
name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299"
class="citation">[299]</a> the same story is told.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The binder has brought me eight
Bibles,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;which he has contrived to make
up out of <i>the sheets gnawn by the rats</i>, and which would
have been necessary even had they amounted to eight thousand (y
era necesario se puvi&egrave;ran vuelto 8000), because the people
are innumerable who come to seek more.&nbsp; Don Santiago has
been here with some friends, who insisted upon having a part of
them.&nbsp; The Aragonese Gentleman has likewise been, he who
came before your departure, and bespoke twenty-four; he now wants
twenty-five.&nbsp; I begged them to take Testaments, but they
would not.&rdquo; <a name="citation300"></a><a
href="#footnote300" class="citation">[300]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greek bricklayer proved a most useful agent.&nbsp; His
great influence with his poor acquaintances resulted in the sale
of many Testaments.&nbsp; More could have been done had it not
been necessary to proceed with extreme caution, lest the
authorities should take action and seize the small stock of books
that remained.</p>
<p>When he took and furnished the large house in the little
square, there had been in Borrow&rsquo;s mind another reason than
a desire for solitude and freedom from prying eyes.&nbsp;
Throughout his labours in Spain he had kept up a correspondence
with Mrs Clarke of Oulton, who, on 15th March, had written
informing him of her intention to take up her abode for a short
time at Seville.</p>
<p>For some time previously Mrs Clarke had been having trouble
about her estate.&nbsp; Her mother (September 1835) and father
(February 1836) were both dead, and her brother Breame had
inherited the estate and she the mortgage together with the
Cottage on Oulton Broad.&nbsp; Breame Skepper died (May 1837),
leaving a wife and six children.&nbsp; In his will he had
appointed Trustees, who demanded the sale of the Estate and
division of the money, which was opposed by Mrs Clarke as
executrix and mortgagee.&nbsp; Later it was agreed between the
parties that the Estate should be sold for &pound;11,000 to a Mr
Joseph Cator Webb, and an agreement to that effect was
signed.&nbsp; Anticipating that the Estate would increase in
value, and apparently regretting their bargain, the Trustees
delayed carrying out their undertaking, and Mr Webb filed a bill
in Chancery to force them to do so.&nbsp; Mrs Clarke&rsquo;s
legal advisers thought it better that she should disappear for a
time.&nbsp; Hence her letter to Borrow, in replying to which
(29th March), he expresses pleasure at the news of his
friend&rsquo;s determination &ldquo;to settle in Seville for a
short time&mdash;which, I assure you, I consider to be the most
agreeable retreat you can select . . . for <i>there</i> the
growls of your enemies will scarcely reach you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
goes on to tell her that he laughed outright at the advice of her
counsellor not to take a house and furnish it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Houses in Spain are let by the day: and in
a palace here you will find less furniture than in your cottage
at Oulton.&nbsp; Were you to furnish a Spanish house in the style
of cold, wintry England, you would be unable to breathe.&nbsp; A
few chairs, tables, and mattresses are all that is required, with
of course a good stock of bed-linen . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring with you, therefore, your clothes, plenty of
bed-linen, etc., half-a-dozen blankets, two dozen knives and
forks, a mirror or two, twelve silver table spoons, and a large
one for soup, tea things and urn (for the Spaniards never drink
tea), a few books, but not many,&mdash;and you will have occasion
for nothing more, or, if you have, you can purchase it here as
cheap as in England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s ideas of domestic comfort were those of the old
campaigner.&nbsp; For all that, he showed himself very thorough
in the directions he gave as to how and where Mrs Clarke should
book her passage and obtain &ldquo;a passport for yourself and
Hen.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Henrietta her daughter, now nearly twenty
years of age), and the warning he gave that no attempt should be
made to go ashore at Lisbon, &ldquo;a very dangerous
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 7th June Mrs Clarke and her daughter Henrietta sailed from
London on board the steam-packet <i>Royal Tar</i> bound for
Cadiz, where they arrived on the 16th, and, on the day following,
entered into possession of their temporary home where Borrow was
already installed, safe for the time from Mr Webb&rsquo;s
Chancery bill.&nbsp; It was no doubt to Mrs and Miss Clarke that
Borrow referred when he wrote to Mr Brandram <a
name="citation301"></a><a href="#footnote301"
class="citation">[301]</a> saying that &ldquo;two or three ladies
of my acquaintance occasionally dispose of some [Testaments]
amongst their friends, but they say that they experience some
difficulty, the cry for Bibles being great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow continued to reside at 7 Plazuela de la Pila Seca, and
Mrs Clarke and Henrietta soon learned something of the
vicissitudes and excitements of a missionary&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
On Sunday, 8th July, as Borrow &ldquo;happened to be reading the
Liturgy,&rdquo; he received a visit from &ldquo;various
<i>alguacils</i>, headed by the <i>Alcade del Barrio</i>, or
headborough, who made a small seizure of Testaments and Gypsy
Gospels which happened to be lying about.&rdquo; <a
name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a>&nbsp; This circumstance convinced
Borrow of the good effect of his labours in and around
Seville.</p>
<p>The time had now arrived, however, when the whole of the
smuggled Testaments had been disposed of, and there was no object
in remaining longer in Seville, or in Spain for that
matter.&nbsp; There were books at San Lucar that might without
official opposition be shipped out of the country, and Borrow
therefore determined to see what could be done towards
distributing them among the Spanish residents on the Coast of
Barbary.&nbsp; This done, he hoped to return to Spain and dispose
of the 900 odd Testaments lying at Madrid.&nbsp; On 18th July he
wrote to Mr Brandram:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should wish to be permitted on my return
from my present expedition to circulate some in La Mancha.&nbsp;
The state of that province is truly horrible; it appears peopled
partly with spectres and partly with demons.&nbsp; There is
famine, and such famine; there is assassination and such
unnatural assassination [another of Borrow&rsquo;s phrases that
must have struck the Committee as odd].&nbsp; There you see
soldiers and robbers, ghastly lepers and horrible and uncouth
maimed and blind, exhibiting their terrible nakedness in the
sun.&nbsp; I was prevented last year in carrying the Gospel
amongst them.&nbsp; May I be more successful this.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antonio had been dismissed, his master being &ldquo;compelled
to send [him] back to Madrid . . . on account of his many
irregularities,&rdquo; and in consequence it was alone, on the
night of 31st July, that Borrow set out upon his
expedition.&nbsp; From Seville he took the steamer to Bonanza,
from whence he drove to San Lucar, where he picked up a chest of
New Testaments and a small box of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel in
Gitano, with a pass for them to Cadiz.&nbsp; It proved expensive,
this claiming of his own property, for at every step there was
some fee to be paid or gratuity to be given.&nbsp; The last
payment was made to the Spanish Consul at Gibraltar, who claimed
and received a dollar for certifying the arrival of books he had
not seen.</p>
<p>Borrow was instinctively a missionary, even a great
missionary.&nbsp; At the Customs House of San Lucar some
questions were asked about the books contained in the cases, and
he seized the occasion to hold an informal missionary meeting,
with the officials clustered round him listening to his
discourse.&nbsp; One of the cases had to be opened for
inspection, and the upshot of it was that, to the very officials
whose duty it was to see that the books were not distributed in
Spain, Borrow sold a number of copies, not only of the Spanish
Testament, but of the Gypsy St Luke.&nbsp; Such was the power of
his personality and the force of his eloquence.</p>
<p>From San Lucar Borrow returned to Bonanza and again took the
boat, which landed him at Cadiz, where he was hospitably
entertained by Mr Brackenbury, the British Consul, who gave him a
letter of introduction to Mr Drummond Hay, the Consul-General at
Tangier.&nbsp; On 4th August he proceeded to Gibraltar.&nbsp; It
was not until the 8th, however, that he was able to cross to
Tangier, where he was kindly received by Mr Hay, who found for
him a very comfortable lodging.</p>
<p>Taking the Consul&rsquo;s advice, Borrow proceeded with
extreme caution.&nbsp; For the first fortnight of his stay he
made no effort to distribute his Testaments, contenting himself
with studying the town and its inhabitants, occasionally speaking
to the Christians in the place (principally Spanish and Genoese
sailors and their families) about religious matters, but always
with the greatest caution lest the two or three friars, who
resided at what was known as the Spanish Convent, should become
alarmed.&nbsp; Again Borrow obtained the services of a curious
assistant, a Jewish lad named Hayim Ben Attar, who carried the
Testaments to the people&rsquo;s houses and offered them for
sale, and this with considerable success.&nbsp; On 4th September
Borrow wrote to Mr Brandram:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The blessed book is now in the hands of
most of the Christians of Tangier, from the lowest to the
highest, from the fisherman to the consul.&nbsp; One dozen and a
half were carried to Tetuan on speculation, a town about six
leagues from hence; they will be offered to the Christians who
reside there.&nbsp; Other two dozen are on their way to distant
Mogadore.&nbsp; One individual, a tavern keeper, has purchased
Testaments to the number of thirty, which he says he has no doubt
he can dispose of to the foreign sailors who stop occasionally at
his house.&nbsp; You will be surprised to hear that several
amongst the Jews have purchased copies of the New Testament with
the intention, as they state, of improving themselves in Spanish,
but I believe from curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his stay in Tangier, Borrow had some trouble with the
British Vice-Consul, who seems to have made himself extremely
offensive with his persistent offers of service.&nbsp; His face
was &ldquo;purple and blue&rdquo; and in whose blood-shot eyes
there was an expression &ldquo;much like that of a departed tunny
fish or salmon,&rdquo; and he became so great an annoyance that
Borrow made a complaint to Mr Drummond Hay.&nbsp; This is one of
the few instances of Borrow&rsquo;s experiencing difficulty with
any British official, for, as a rule, he was extremely
popular.&nbsp; In this particular instance, however, the
Vice-Consul was so obviously seeking to make profit out of his
official position, that there was no other means open to Borrow
than to make a formal complaint.</p>
<p>In the case of Mr Drummond Hay, he obtained the friendship of
a &ldquo;true British gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first the Consul
had been reserved and distant, and apparently by no means
inclined to render Borrow any service in the furtherance of his
mission; but a few days sufficed to bring him under the influence
of Borrow&rsquo;s personal magnetism, and he ended by assuring
him that he would be happy to receive the Society&rsquo;s
commands, and would render all possible assistance, officially or
otherwise, to the distribution of the Scriptures &ldquo;in Fez or
Morocco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was thoroughly satisfied with the result of his five
weeks&rsquo; stay in Tangier.&nbsp; He reached Cadiz on his way
to Seville on 21st Sept., after undergoing a four days&rsquo;
quarantine at Tarifa, when he wrote to Mr Brandram (29th
Sept.):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am very glad that I went to Tangier, for
many reasons.&nbsp; In the first place, I was permitted to
circulate many copies of God&rsquo;s Word both among the Jews and
the Christians, by the latter of whom it was particularly wanted,
their ignorance of the most vital points of religion being truly
horrible.&nbsp; In the second place, I acquired a vast stock of
information concerning Africa and the state of its
interior.&nbsp; One of my principal Associates was a black slave
whose country was only three days&rsquo; journey from Timbuctoo,
which place he had frequently visited.&nbsp; The Soos men also
told me many of the secrets of the land of wonders from which
they come, and the Rabbis from Fez and Morocco were no less
communicative.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow had started upon his expedition to the Barbary Coast
without any definite instructions from Earl Street.&nbsp; On 29th
July the Sub-Committee had resolved that as his mission to Spain
was &ldquo;nearly attained by the disposal of the larger part of
the Spanish Scriptures which he went out to distribute,&rdquo;
the General Committee be recommended to request him to take
measures for selling or placing in safe custody all copies
remaining on hand and returning to England &ldquo;without loss of
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was adopted on 5th Aug.; but before it
received the formal sanction of the General Committee Mr Browne
had written (29th July) to Borrow acquainting him with the
feeling of the Sub-Committee, thinking that he ought to have
early intimation of what was taking place.&nbsp; This letter
Borrow found awaiting him at Cadiz on his return from
Tangier.&nbsp; He replied immediately (21st Sept.):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had I been aware of that resolution before
my departure for Tangier I certainly should not have gone; my
expedition, however, was the result of much reflection.&nbsp; I
wished to carry the Gospel to the Christians of the Barbary
shore, who were much in want of it; and I had one hundred and
thirty Testaments at San Lucar, which I could only make available
by exportation.&nbsp; The success which it has pleased the Lord
to yield me in my humble efforts at distribution in Barbary will,
I believe, prove the best criterion as to the fitness of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stated in my last communication to Mr Brandram the
plan which I conceived to be the best for circulating that
portion of the edition of the New Testament which remains unsold
at Madrid, and I scarcely needed a stimulant in the execution of
my duty.&nbsp; At present, however, I know not what to do; I am
sorrowful, disappointed and unstrung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to return to England as soon as possible; but I
have books and papers at Madrid which are of much importance to
me and which I cannot abandon, this perhaps alone prevents me
embarking in the next packet.&nbsp; I have, moreover, brought
with me from Tangier the Jewish youth [Hayim Ben Attar], who so
powerfully assisted me in that place in the work of
distribution.&nbsp; I had hoped to have made him of service in
Spain, he is virtuous and clever . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost tempted to ask whether some strange, some
unaccountable delusion does not exist: what should induce me to
stay in Spain, as you appear to suppose I intend?&nbsp; I may,
however, have misunderstood you.&nbsp; I wish to receive a fresh
communication as soon as possible, either from yourself or Mr
Brandram; in the meantime I shall go to Seville, to which place
and to the usual number pray direct.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the Bible Society had become aware of
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>m&eacute;nage</i> at Seville, and concluded
that he meant to take up his abode in Spain more or less
permanently.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s next plan was to order a chest of Testaments to
be sent to La Mancha, where he had friends, then to mount his
horse and proceed there in person.&nbsp; With the assistance of
his Jewish body-servant he hoped to circulate many copies before
the authorities became aware of his presence.&nbsp; Later he
would proceed to Madrid, put his affairs in order, and make for
France by way of Saragossa (where he hoped to accomplish some
good), and then&mdash;home.</p>
<p>In September a circular signed by Lord Palmerston was received
by all the British Consuls in Spain, strictly forbidding them
&ldquo;to afford the slightest countenance to religious agents.
<a name="citation307a"></a><a href="#footnote307a"
class="citation">[307a]</a>&nbsp; What was the cause of this last
blow?&rdquo; <a name="citation307b"></a><a href="#footnote307b"
class="citation">[307b]</a>&nbsp; Borrow rather unfortunately
enquired of Mr Brandram.&nbsp; The Consul at Cadiz, Mr
Brackenbury, explained it, according to Borrow, as due to
&ldquo;an ill-advised application made to his Lordship to
interfere with the Spanish Government on behalf of a certain
individual <a name="citation307c"></a><a href="#footnote307c"
class="citation">[307c]</a> [Lieut. Graydon] whose line of
conduct needs no comment.&rdquo; <a name="citation307d"></a><a
href="#footnote307d" class="citation">[307d]</a>&nbsp; After
pointing out that once the same consuls had received from a
British Ambassador instructions to further, in their official
capacity, the work of the Bible Society, he concludes with the
following remark, as ill-advised as it is droll: &ldquo;When dead
flies fall into the ointment of the apothecary they cause it to
send forth an unpleasant savour.&rdquo; <a
name="citation308a"></a><a href="#footnote308a"
class="citation">[308a]</a></p>
<p>It must have been obvious to both Borrow and Mr Brandram that
matters were rapidly approaching a crisis.&nbsp; Mr Brandram
seems to have been almost openly hostile, and draws
Borrow&rsquo;s attention to the fact that after all his
distributions have been small.&nbsp; Borrow replies by saying
that the fault did not rest with him.&nbsp; Had he been able to
offer Bibles instead of Testaments for sale, the circulation
would have been ten times greater.&nbsp; He expresses it as his
belief that had he received 20,000 Bibles he could have sold them
all in Madrid during the Spring of 1839.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the Bible Society has no further
occasion for my poor labours,&rdquo; he wrote <a
name="citation308b"></a><a href="#footnote308b"
class="citation">[308b]</a> somewhat pathetically, &ldquo;I hope
it will do me justice to the world.&nbsp; I have been its
faithful and zealous servant.&nbsp; I shall on a future occasion
take the liberty of addressing you as a friend respecting my
prospects.&nbsp; I have the materials of a curious book of
travels in Spain; I have enough metrical translations from all
languages, especially the Celtic and Sclavonic, to fill a dozen
volumes; and I have formed a vocabulary of the Spanish Gypsy
tongue, and also a collection of the songs and poetry of the
Gitanos, with introductory essays.&nbsp; Perhaps some of these
literary labours might be turned to account.&nbsp; I wish to
obtain honourably and respectably the means of visiting China or
particular parts of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from this that Borrow saw how unlikely it was that
his association with the Bible Society would be prolonged beyond
the present commission.&nbsp; For one thing Spain was, to all
intents and purposes, closed to the unannotated Scriptures.&nbsp;
Something might be done in the matter of surreptitious
distribution; but that had its clearly defined limitations, as
the authorities were very much alive to the danger of the light
that Borrow sought to cast over the gloom of ignorance and
superstition.</p>
<p>At Earl Street it was clearly recognised that Borrow&rsquo;s
work in Spain was concluded.&nbsp; On 1st November the
Sub-Committee resolved that it could &ldquo;not recommend to the
General Committee to engage the further services of Mr Borrow
until he shall have returned to this country from his Mission in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, on 10th January following, it
recommends the General Committee to recall him &ldquo;without
further delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he had been officially recalled, nothing was further
from Borrow&rsquo;s intentions than to retire meekly from the
field.&nbsp; He intended to retreat with drums sounding and
colours flying, fighting something more than a rearguard
action.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s energy and resource were
terrible&mdash;to the authorities!&nbsp; Seville he felt was
still a fruitful ground, and sending to Madrid for further
supplies of Testaments, he commenced operations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everything was accomplished with the utmost secrecy, and
the blessed books obtained considerable circulation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309"
class="citation">[309]</a>&nbsp; Agents were sent into the
country and he went also himself, &ldquo;in my accustomed
manner,&rdquo; until all the copies that had arrived from the
capital were put into circulation.&nbsp; He then rested for a
while, being in need of quiet, as he was indisposed.</p>
<p>By this action Borrow was incurring no little risk.&nbsp; The
Canons of the Cathedral watched him closely.&nbsp; Their hatred
amounted &ldquo;almost to a frenzy,&rdquo; and Borrow states that
scarcely a day passed without some accusation of other being made
to the Civil Governor, all of which were false.&nbsp; People whom
he had never seen were persuaded to perjure themselves by
swearing that he had sold or given them books.&nbsp; The same
system was carried on whilst he was in Africa, because the
authorities refused to believe that he was out of Spain.</p>
<p>There now occurred another regrettable incident, and Borrow
once more suffered for the indiscretion of those whom he neither
knew nor controlled.&nbsp; To Mr Brandram he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some English people now came to Seville and
distributed tracts in a very unguarded manner, knowing nothing of
the country or the inhabitants.&nbsp; They were even so unwise as
<i>to give tracts instead of money on visiting public
buildings</i>, <i>etc.</i> [!].&nbsp; These persons came to me
and requested my co&ouml;peration and advice, and likewise
introductions to people spiritually disposed amongst the
Spaniards, to all which requests I returned a decided
negative.&nbsp; But I foresaw all.&nbsp; In a day or two I was
summoned before the Civil Governor, or, as he was once called,
the <i>Corregidor</i>, of Seville, who, I must say, treated me
with the utmost politeness and indeed respect; but at the same
time he informed me that he had (to use his own expression)
terrible orders from Madrid concerning me if I should be
discovered in the act of distributing the Scriptures or any
writings of a religious tendency; he then taxed me with having
circulated both lately, especially tracts; whereupon I told him
that I had never distributed a tract since I had been in Spain
nor had any intention of doing so.&nbsp; We had much conversation
and parted in kindness.&rdquo; <a name="citation310"></a><a
href="#footnote310" class="citation">[310]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a few days nothing happened; then, determined to set out
on an expedition to La Mancha (the delay had been due to the
insecure state of the roads), Borrow sent his passport (24th
Nov.) for signature to the <i>Alcalde del Barrio</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This fellow,&rdquo; Borrow informs Mr
Brandram, &ldquo;is the greatest ruffian in Seville, and I have
on various occasions been insulted by him; he pretends to be a
liberal, but he is of no principle at all, and as I reside within
his district he has been employed by the Canons of the Cathedral
to vex and harrass me on every possible occasion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following letter, addressed to the British
<i>Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires</i> (the Hon. G. S. S.
Jerningham), Borrow gives a full account of what transpired
between him and the <i>Alcalde</i> of Seville:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I beg leave to lay before you the following statement of
certain facts which lately occurred at Seville, from which you
will perceive that the person of a British Subject has been
atrociously outraged, the rights and privileges of a foreigner in
Spain violated, and the sanctuary of a private house invaded
without the slightest reason or shadow of authority by a person
in the employ of the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>For some months past I have been a resident at Seville in a
house situated in a square called the &ldquo;Plazuela de la Pila
Seca.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this house I possess apartments, the
remainder being occupied by an English Lady and her daughter, the
former of whom is the widow of an officer of the highest
respectability who died in the naval service of Great
Britain.&nbsp; On the twenty-fourth of last November, I sent a
servant, a Native of Spain, to the Office of the
&ldquo;<i>Ayuntamiento</i>&rdquo; of Seville for the purpose of
demanding my passport, it being my intention to set out the next
day for Cordoba.&nbsp; The &ldquo;<i>Ayuntamiento</i>&rdquo;
returned for answer that it was necessary that the ticket of
residence (<i>Billete de residencia</i>) which I had received on
sending in the Passport should be signed by the <i>Alcalde</i> of
the district in which I resided, to which intimation I instantly
attended.&nbsp; I will here take the liberty of observing that on
several occasions during my residence at Seville, I have
experienced gross insults from this <i>Alcalde</i>, and that more
than once when I have had occasion to leave the Town, he has
refused to sign the necessary document for the recovery of the
passport; he now again refused to do so, and used coarse language
to the Messenger; whereupon I sent the latter back with money to
pay any fees, lawful or unlawful, which might be demanded, as I
wished to avoid noise and the necessity of applying to the
Consul, Mr Williams; but the fellow became only more
outrageous.&nbsp; I then went myself to demand an explanation,
and was saluted with no inconsiderable quantity of abuse.&nbsp; I
told him that if he proceeded in this manner I would make a
complaint to the Authorities through the British Consul.&nbsp; He
then said if I did not instantly depart he would drag me off to
prison and cause me to be knocked down if I made the slightest
resistance.&nbsp; I dared him repeatedly to do both, and said
that he was a disgrace to the Government which employed him, and
to human nature.&nbsp; He called me a vile foreigner.&nbsp; We
were now in the street and a mob had collected, whereupon I
cried: &ldquo;Viva Inglaterra y viva la
Constitucion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The populace remained quiet,
notwithstanding the exhortations of the <i>Alcalde</i> that they
would knock down &ldquo;the foreigner,&rdquo; for he himself
quailed before me as I looked him in the face, defying him.&nbsp;
At length he exclaimed, with the usual obscene Spanish oath,
&ldquo;I will make you lower your head&rdquo; (Yo te har&eacute;
abajar la cabeza), and ran to a neighbouring guard-house and
requested the assistance of the Nationals in conducting me to
prison.&nbsp; I followed him and delivered myself up at the first
summons, and walked to the prison without uttering a word; not so
the <i>Alcalde</i>, who continued his abuse until we arrived at
the gate, repeatedly threatening to have me knocked down if I
moved to the right or left.</p>
<p>I was asked my name by the Authorities of the prison, which I
refused to give unless in the presence of the Consul of my
Nation, and indeed to answer any questions.&nbsp; I was then
ordered to the <i>Patio</i>, or Courtyard, where are kept the
lowest thieves and assassins of Seville, who, having no money,
cannot pay for better accommodation, and by whom I should have
been stripped naked in a moment as a matter of course, as they
are all in a state of raging hunger and utter destitution.&nbsp;
I asked for a private cell, which I was told I might have if I
could pay for it.&nbsp; I stated my willingness to pay anything
which might be demanded, and was conducted to an upper ward
consisting of several cells and a corridor; here I found six or
seven Prisoners, who received me very civilly, and instantly
procured me paper and ink for the purpose of writing to the
Consul.&nbsp; In less than an hour Mr Williams arrived and I told
him my story, whereupon he instantly departed in order to demand
redress of the Authorities.&nbsp; The next morning the
<i>Alcalde</i>, without any authority from the Political [Civil]
Governor of Seville, and unaccompanied by the English Consul, as
the law requires in such cases, and solely attended by a common
<i>Escribano</i>, went to the house in which I was accustomed to
reside and demanded admission.&nbsp; The door was opened by my
Moorish Servant, Hayim Ben-Attar, whom he commanded instantly to
show the way to my apartments.&nbsp; On the Servant&rsquo;s
demanding by what authority he came, he said, &ldquo;Cease
chattering&rdquo; (Deje cuentos), &ldquo;I shall give no account
to you; show me the way; if not, I will take you to prison as I
did your master: I come to search for prohibited
books.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Moor, who being in a strange land was
somewhat intimidated, complied and led him to the rooms occupied
by me, when the <i>Alcalde</i> flung about my books and papers,
finding nothing which could in the slightest degree justify his
search, the few books being all either in Hebrew or Arabic
character (they consisted of the Mitchna and some commentaries on
the Coran); he at last took up a large knife which lay on a chair
and which I myself purchased some months previous at Santa Cruz
in La Mancha as a curiosity&mdash;the place being famous for
those knives&mdash;and expressed his determination to take it
away as a prohibited article.&nbsp; The <i>Escribano</i>,
however, cautioned him against doing so, and he flung it
down.&nbsp; He now became very vociferous and attempted to force
his way into some apartments occupied by the Ladies, my friends;
but soon desisted and at last went away, after using some
threatening words to my Moorish Servant.&nbsp; Late at night of
the second day of my imprisonment, I was set at liberty by virtue
of an order of the Captain General, given on application of the
British Consul, after having been for thirty hours imprisoned
amongst the worst felons of Andalusia, though to do them justice
I must say that I experienced from them nothing but kindness and
hospitality.</p>
<p>The above, Sir, is the correct statement of the affair which
has now brought me to Madrid.&nbsp; What could have induced the
<i>Alcalde</i> in question to practise such atrocious behaviour
towards me I am at a loss to conjecture, unless he were
instigated by certain enemies which I possess in Seville.&nbsp;
However this may be, I now call upon you, as the Representative
of the Government of which I am a Subject, to demand of the
Minister of the Spanish Crown full and ample satisfaction for the
various outrages detailed above.&nbsp; In conclusion, I must be
permitted to add that I will submit to no compromise, but will
never cease to claim justice until the culprit has received
condign punishment.</p>

<a name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313"

</blockquote>
<p>Thus it happened that on 19th December Mr Brandram received
the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Prison of Seville</span>, 25<i>th</i> <i>Nov.</i>
1839.</p>
<p>I write these lines, as you see, from the common prison of
Seville, to which I was led yesterday, or rather dragged, neither
for murder nor robbery nor debt, but simply for having
endeavoured to obtain a passport for Cordoba, to which place I
was going with my Jewish servant Hayim Ben-Attar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When questioned by the Vice-Consul as to his authority for
searching Borrow&rsquo;s house, the <i>Alcalde</i> produced a
paper purporting to be the deposition of an old woman to whom
Borrow was alleged to have sold a Testament some ten days
previously.&nbsp; The document Borrow pronounced a forgery and
the statement untrue.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s fellow-prisoners treated him with unbounded
kindness and hospitality, and he was forced to confess that he
had &ldquo;never found himself amongst more quiet and
well-behaved men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing shows more clearly the
power of Borrow&rsquo;s personality over rogues and vagabonds
than the two periods spent in Spanish prisons&mdash;at Madrid and
at Seville.&nbsp; Mr Brandram must have shuddered when he read
Borrow&rsquo;s letter telling him by what manner of men he was
surrounded.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What is their history?&rdquo; he writes
apropos of his fellow-prisoners.&nbsp; &ldquo;The handsome
black-haired man, who is now looking over my shoulder, is the
celebrated thief, Pelacio, the most expert housebreaker and
dexterous swindler in Spain&mdash;in a word, the modern Guzman
D&rsquo;alfarache.&nbsp; The brawny man who sits by the
<i>brasero</i> of charcoal is Salvador, the highwayman of Ronda,
who has committed a hundred murders.&nbsp; A fashionably dressed
man, short and slight in person, is walking about the room: he
wears immense whiskers and mustachios; he is one of that most
singular race the Jews of Spain; he is imprisoned for
counterfeiting money.&nbsp; He is an atheist; but, like a true
Jew, the name which he most hates is that of Christ.&nbsp; Yet he
is so quiet and civil, and they are all so quiet and civil, and
it is that which most horrifies me, for quietness and civility in
them seems so unnatural.&rdquo; <a name="citation315"></a><a
href="#footnote315" class="citation">[315]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such were the men who fraternised with an agent of a religious
society and showed him not only civility but hospitality and
kindness.&nbsp; It is open to question if they would have shown
the same to any other unfortunate missionary.&nbsp; In all
probability they recognised a fellow-vagabond, who was at much at
issue with the social conventions of communities as they were
with the laws of property.</p>
<p>On this occasion the period of Borrow&rsquo;s imprisonment was
brief.&nbsp; He was released late at night on 25th Nov., within
thirty hours of his arrest, and he immediately set to work to
think out a plan by which he could once more discomfit the
Spanish authorities for this indignity to a British
subject.&nbsp; He would proceed to Madrid without delay and put
his case before the British Minister, at the same time he would
&ldquo;make preparations for leaving Spain as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
DECEMBER 1839&ndash;MAY 1840</h2>
<p>It was probably about this time (1839) that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Marqu&eacute;s de Santa Coloma met
Borrow again at Seville.&nbsp; He had great difficulty in finding
him out; though he was aware of the street in which he resided,
no one knew him by name.&nbsp; At last, by dint of inquiry and
description, some one exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh! you mean el
Brujo&rsquo; (the wizard), and he was directed to the
house.&nbsp; He was admitted with great caution, and conducted
through a lot of passages and stairs, till at last he was ushered
into a handsomely furnished apartment in the
&lsquo;<i>mirador</i>,&rsquo; where Borrow was living <i>with his
wife and daughter</i>. . .&nbsp; It is evident . . . that, to his
Spanish friends at least, he thus called Mrs Clarke and her
daughter Henrietta his wife and daughter: and the Marqu&eacute;s
de Santa Coloma evidently believed that the young lady was
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>own</i> daughter, and not his step-daughter
merely (!).&nbsp; At the time the roads from Seville to Madrid
were very unsafe.&nbsp; Santa Coloma wished Borrow to join his
party, who were going well armed.&nbsp; Borrow said he would be
safe with his Gypsies.&nbsp; Both arrived without accident in
Madrid; the Marqu&eacute;s&rsquo;s party first.&nbsp; Borrow, on
his arrival, told Santa Coloma that his Gypsy chief had led him
by by-paths and mountains; that they had not slept in a village,
nor seen a town the whole way.&rdquo; <a
name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316"
class="citation">[316]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be confessed that Mr Webster was none too reliable a
witness, and it seems highly improbable that Borrow would wish to
pass Mrs Clarke off as his wife before their marriage.&nbsp; The
fact of their occupying the same house may have seemed to their
Spanish friends compromising, as it unquestionably was; but had
he spoken of Mrs Clarke as his wife, it would have left her not a
vestige of reputation.</p>
<p>On arriving at Madrid Borrow found that Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s
successor, Mr Arthur Aston, had not yet arrived, he therefore
presented his complaint to the <i>Charg&eacute;
d&rsquo;Affaires</i>, the Hon. G. S. S. Jerningham, who had
succeeded Mr Sothern as private secretary.&nbsp; Mr Sothern had
not yet left Madrid to take up his new post as First Secretary at
Lisbon, and therefore presented Borrow to Mr Jerningham, by whom
he was received with great kindness.&nbsp; He assured Mr
Jerningham that for some time past he had given up distributing
the Scriptures in Spain, and he merely claimed the privileges of
a British subject and the protection of his Government.&nbsp; The
First Secretary took up the case immediately, forwarding
Borrow&rsquo;s letter to Don Perez de Castro with a request for
&ldquo;proper steps to be taken, should Mr Borrow&rsquo;s
complaint . . . be considered by His Excellency as properly
founded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow himself was doubtful as to whether
he would obtain justice, &ldquo;for I have against me,&rdquo; he
wrote to Mr Brandram (24th December), &ldquo;the Canons of
Seville; and all the arts of villany which they are so accustomed
to practise will of course be used against me for the purpose of
screening the ruffian who is their instrument. . . .&nbsp; I have
been, my dear Sir, fighting with wild beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rather quaint reply to Borrow&rsquo;s charges was not
forthcoming until he had left Spain and was living at
Oulton.&nbsp; It runs: <a name="citation317"></a><a
href="#footnote317" class="citation">[317]</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Madrid</span>, 11<i>th</i> <i>May</i> 1840.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Under date of 20th December last, Mr Perez de Castro informed
Mr Jerningham that in order to answer satisfactorily his note of
8th December <i>re</i> complaint made by Borrow, he required a
faithful report to be made.&nbsp; These have been stated by the
Municipality of Seville to the Civil Governor of that City, and
are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Borrow meant to undertake his journey to Cadiz
towards the end of last year, he applied to the section of public
security for his Passport, for which purpose he ought to deliver
his paper of residence which was given to him when he arrived at
Seville.&nbsp; That paper he had not presented in its proper time
to the <i>Alcalde</i> of his district, on which account this
person had not been acquainted as he ought with his residence in
the district, and as his Passport could not be issued in
consequence of this document not being in order, Borrow
addressed, through the medium of a Servant, to the house of the
said district <i>Alcalde</i> that the defect might be
remedied.&nbsp; That functionary refused to do so, founded on the
reasons already stated; and for the purpose of overcoming his
resistance he was offered a gratification, the Servant with that
intent presenting half a dollar.&nbsp; The <i>Alcalde</i>, justly
indignant, left his house to make the necessary complaint
respecting their indecorous action when he met Borrow, who,
surprised at the refusal of the <i>Alcalde</i>, expressed to him
his astonishment, addressing insulting expressions not only
against his person but against the authorities of Spain, who, he
said, he was sure were to be bought at a very small
price&mdash;crying on after this, Long live the Constitution,
Death to the Religion, and Long live England.&nbsp; These and
other insults gave rise to the <i>Alcalde</i> proceeding to his
arrest and the assistance of the armed force of Veterans, and not
of the National Militia, as Borrow supposed, making a detailed
report to the Constitutional <i>Alcalde</i>, who forwarded it
original to the Captain General of the Province as Judge
Protector of Foreigners, leaving him under detention at his
disposition.&nbsp; He did the same with another report
transmitted by the said functionary, in which reference to a Lady
who lived at the Gate of Xerez; he denounced Borrow as a seducer
of youth in matters of Religion by facilitating to them the
perusal of prohibited books, of which a copy, that was in the
hands of the Ecclesiastical Governor, was likewise transmitted to
the Captain General.&nbsp; These antecedents were sufficient to
have authorised a summary to have been formed against Borrow, but
the repeated supplications of the British Vice-Consul, Mr
Williams, who among other things stated that Borrow laboured
under fits of madness, had the effect of causing the above
Constitutional <i>Alcalde</i> to forgive him the fault committed
and recommend to the Captain General that the matter should be
dropped, which was acceded to, and he was put at liberty.&nbsp;
The above facts, official proofs of which exist in the Captain
General&rsquo;s Office, clearly disprove the statement of Borrow,
who ungrateful for the generous hospitality which he has
received, and for the consideration displayed towards him on
account of his infirmity, and out of deference to the request of
the British Vice-Consul, makes an unfounded complaint against the
very authorities who have used attentions towards him which he is
certainly not deserving; it being worthy of remark, in order to
prove the bad faith of his procedure, that in his own
<i>expos&eacute;</i>, although he disfigures facts at pleasure,
using a language little decorous, he confesses part of his
faults, such as the offering of money <i>to pay</i>, as he says,
&lsquo;<i>the legal or extra-legal dues that might be
exacted</i>, and his having twice challenged the
<i>Alcalde</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should consider myself wanting towards your
enlightened sense of justice if, after the reasons given, I
stopped to prove the just and prudent conduct of Seville
authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he will therefore be completely satisfied,
especially after the want of exactitude on Borrow&rsquo;s
part.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">From</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Evaristo Perez
De Castro</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Mr Aston. <a name="citation319"></a><a href="#footnote319"
class="citation">[319]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the matter ended.&nbsp; The Spanish authorities knew
that they no longer had a Sir George Villiers to deal with, and
had recourse to that trump card of weak and vacillating
diplomatists&mdash;delay.&nbsp; Whatever Borrow&rsquo;s offence,
the method of his arrest and imprisonment was in itself
unlawful.</p>
<p>It was Borrow&rsquo;s intention on his return to England to
endeavour to obtain an interview with some members of the House
of Lords, in order to acquaint them with the manner in which
Protestants were persecuted in Spain.&nbsp; They were debarred
from the exercise of their religion from being married by
Protestant rites, and the common privileges of burial were denied
them.&nbsp; He was anxious for Protestant England, lest it should
fall a victim to Popery.&nbsp; This fear of Rome was a very real
one to Borrow.&nbsp; He marvelled at people&rsquo;s blindness to
the danger that was threatening them, and he even went so far as
to entreat his friends at Earl Street &ldquo;to drop all petty
dissensions and to comport themselves like brothers&rdquo;
against their common enemy the Pope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Borrow had shown to a number of friends one of
his letters to Mr Brandram dealing with the Seville imprisonment,
and had even allowed several copies of it to be taken &ldquo;in
order that an incorrect account of the affair might not get
abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result was an article in a London
newspaper containing remarks to the disparagement of other
workers for the Gospel in Spain.&nbsp; Borrow disavowed all
knowledge of these observations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of the Methodists of
Cadiz,&rdquo; he assures Mr Brandram, &ldquo;their conduct in
many respects does them honor, nor do I accuse any one of
fanaticism amongst our dear and worthy friends; but I cannot
answer for the tittle-tattle of Madrid.&nbsp; Far be it from me
to reflect upon any one, I am but too well aware of my own
multitudinous imperfections and follies.&rdquo; <a
name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320"
class="citation">[320]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing more mysterious in Borrow&rsquo;s life than
his years of friendship with Mrs Clarke.&nbsp; He was never a
woman&rsquo;s man, but Mary Clarke seems to have awakened in him
a very sincere regard.&nbsp; The m&eacute;nage at Seville was a
curious one, and both Borrow and Mrs Clarke should have seen that
it was calculated to make people talk.&nbsp; There may have been
a tacit understanding between them.&nbsp; Everything connected
with their relations and courtship is very mysterious.&nbsp; Dr
Knapp is scarcely just to Borrow or gracious to the woman he
married, when he implies that it was merely a business
arrangement on both sides.&nbsp; Mrs Clarke&rsquo;s affairs
required a man&rsquo;s hand to administer them, and Borrow was
prepared to give the man&rsquo;s hand in exchange for an
income.&nbsp; The engagement could scarcely have taken place in
the middle of November 1839, as Dr Knapp states, for on the day
of his arrest at Seville (24th Nov.) Borrow wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs
Clarke</span>,&mdash;Do not be alarmed, but I am at present in
the prison, to which place the <i>Alcalde</i> del Barrio
conducted me when I asked him to sign the Passport.&nbsp; If
Phelipe is not already gone to the Consul, let Henrietta go now
and show him this letter.&nbsp; When I asked the fellow his
motives for not signing the Passport, he said if I did not go
away he would carry me to prison.&nbsp; I dared him to do so, as
I had done nothing; whereupon he led me here.&mdash;Yours
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously not the letter of a man recently engaged to
the woman who is to become his wife.&nbsp; On the other hand,
Borrow may have been writing merely for the Consul&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>On hearing the news of the engagement old Mrs Borrow
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am not surprised, my dear Mrs Clarke, at
what you tell me, though I knew nothing of it.&nbsp; It put me in
mind of the Revd. Flethers; you know they took time to
consider.&nbsp; So far all is well.&nbsp; I shall now resign him
to your care, and may you love and cherish him as much as I have
done.&nbsp; I hope and trust that each will try to make the other
happy.&nbsp; You will always have my prayers and best
wishes.&nbsp; Give my kind love to dear George and tell him he is
never out of my thoughts.&nbsp; I have much to say, but I cannot
write.&nbsp; I shall be glad to see you all safe and well.&nbsp;
Give my love to Henrietta; tell her <i>I</i> can sing
&lsquo;Gaily the Troubadour&rsquo;; I only want the
&lsquo;guitar.&rsquo; <a name="citation321"></a><a
href="#footnote321" class="citation">[321]</a> God bless you
all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that a very strong friendship had existed
between Mrs Clarke and Borrow during the whole time that he had
been associated with the Bible Society.&nbsp; She it was who had
been indirectly responsible for his introduction to Earl
Street.&nbsp; It is idle to speculate what it was that led Mrs
Clarke to select Seville as the place to which to fly from her
enemies.&nbsp; There is, however, a marked significance in old
Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I am not surprised, my dear Mrs
Clarke, at what you tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever his mother may
have seen, there appears to have been no thought of marriage in
Borrow&rsquo;s mind when, on 29th September 1839, he wrote to Mr
Brandram telling him of his wish to visit &ldquo;China or
particular parts of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow paid many tributes to his wife, not only in his
letters, but in print, every one of which she seems thoroughly to
have merited.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of my wife,&rdquo; he writes, <a
name="citation322"></a><a href="#footnote322"
class="citation">[322]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I will merely say that
she is a perfect paragon of wives&mdash;can make puddings and
sweets and treacle posset, and is the best woman of business in
East Anglia.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion he praises her for
more general qualities, when he compares her to the good wife of
the Triad, the perfect woman endowed with all the feminine
virtues.&nbsp; His wife and &ldquo;old Hen.&rdquo; (Henrietta)
were his &ldquo;two loved ones,&rdquo; and he subsequently shows
in a score of ways how much they had become part of his life.</p>
<p>After his return to Seville, early in January, Borrow
proceeded to get his &ldquo;papers into some order.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There seems no doubt that this meant preparing <i>The Zincali</i>
for publication.&nbsp; In the excitement and enthusiasm of
authorship, and the pleasant company of Mrs and Miss Clarke, he
seems to have been divinely unconscious that he was under orders
to proceed home.&nbsp; Week after week passed without news of
their Agent in Spain reaching Earl Street, and the Officials and
Committee of the Bible Society became troubled to account for his
non-appearance.&nbsp; The last letter from him had been received
on 13th January.&nbsp; Early in March Mr Jackson wrote to Mr
Brackenbury asking for news of him.&nbsp; A letter to Mr Williams
at Seville was enclosed, which Mr Brackenbury had discretionary
powers to withhold if he were able to supply the information
himself.&nbsp; Two letters that Borrow had addressed to the
Society it appears had gone astray, and as &ldquo;one steamer . .
. arrived after another and yet no news from Mr Borrow,&rdquo;
some apprehension began to manifest itself lest misfortune had
befallen him.&nbsp; On the other hand, Borrow had heard nothing
from the Society for five months, the long silence making him
&ldquo;very, very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply to Mr Brandram&rsquo;s letter Borrow
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I did not return to England immediately
after my departure from Madrid for several reasons.&nbsp; First,
there was my affair with the <i>Alcalde</i> still pending;
second, I wished to get my papers into some order; third, I
wished to effect a little more in the cause, though not in the
way of distribution, as I have no books: moreover the house in
which I resided was paid for and I was unwilling altogether to
lose the money; I likewise dreaded an English winter, for I have
lately been subjected to attacks, whether of gout or rheumatism I
know not, which I believe were brought on by sitting, standing
and sleeping in damp places during my wanderings in Spain.&nbsp;
The <i>Alcalde</i> has lately been turned out of his situation,
but I believe more on account of his being a Carlist than for his
behaviour to me; that, however, is of little consequence, as I
have long forgotten the affair.&rdquo; <a
name="citation323a"></a><a href="#footnote323a"
class="citation">[323a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no longer any reason for delay; the English winter
was over, he had one book nearly ready for publication and two
others in a state of forwardness.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I embark on the third of next month
[April],&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and you will probably see me
by the 16th.&nbsp; I wish very much to spend the remaining years
of my life in the northern parts of China, as I think I have a
call for those regions, and shall endeavour by every honourable
means to effect my purpose.&rdquo; <a name="citation323b"></a><a
href="#footnote323b" class="citation">[323b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words would seem to imply that his marriage with Mrs
Clarke was by no means decided upon at the date he wrote,
although during the previous month he had been in correspondence
with Mr Brackenbury regarding Protestants in Spain being debarred
from marrying.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that Mrs Clarke and her
daughter contemplated living in the North of China; and equally
unlikely that Mrs Clarke would marry a potential &ldquo;absentee
landlord,&rdquo; or one who frankly confessed &ldquo;I hope yet
to die in the cause of my Redeemer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidi Habismilk had at first presented a grave problem; but Mr
Brackenbury, who secured the passages on the steamer, arranged
also for the Arab to be slung aboard the Steam-Packet.&nbsp; On
3rd April the whole party, including Hayim Ben Attar and Sidi
Habismilk, boarded the <i>Royal Adelaide</i> bound for
London.</p>
<p>Borrow never forgave Spain for its treatment of him, although
some of the happiest years of his life had been spent
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Spaniards are a stupid, ungrateful set of
ruffians,&rdquo; he afterwards wrote, &ldquo;and are utterly
incapable of appreciating generosity or forbearance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He piled up invective upon the unfortunate country.&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;the chosen land of the two fiends&mdash;assassination and
murder,&rdquo; where avarice and envy were the prevailing
passions.&nbsp; It was the &ldquo;country of error&rdquo;; yet at
the same time &ldquo;the land of extraordinary
characters.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he saw its shores sinking beneath the
horizon, he was mercifully denied the knowledge that never again
was he to be so happily occupied as during the five years he had
spent upon its soil distributing the Scriptures, and using a
British Minister as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p>The party arrived in London on 16th April and put up at the
Spread Eagle in Gracechurch Street.&nbsp; On 23rd April, at St
Peter&rsquo;s Church in Cornhill, the wedding took place.&nbsp;
There were present as witnesses only Henrietta Clarke and John
Pilgrim, the Norwich solicitor.&nbsp; In the Register the names
appear as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;George Henry Borrow&mdash;of full
age&mdash;bachelor&mdash;gentleman&mdash;of the City of
Norwich&mdash;son of Thomas Borrow&mdash;Captain in the Army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Clarke&mdash;of full age&mdash;widow&mdash;of
Spread Eagle Inn, Gracechurch Street&mdash;daughter of Edmund
Skepper&mdash;Esquire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 2nd May an announcement of the marriage appeared in <i>The
Norfolk Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; A few days later the party left for
Oulton Cottage, and Borrow became a landed proprietor on a small
scale in his much-loved East Anglia.</p>
<p>On 21st April Mr Brandram had written to Borrow the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear
Friend</span>,&mdash;Your later communications have been referred
to our Sub-Committee for General Purposes.&nbsp; After what you
said yesterday in the Committee, I am hardly aware that anything
can arise out of them.&nbsp; The door seems shut.&nbsp; The
Sub-Committee meet on Friday.&nbsp; Will you wish to make any
communications to them as to any ulterior views that may have
occurred to yourself?&nbsp; I do not myself at present see any
sphere open to which your services in connection with our Society
can be transferred. . . . With best wishes&mdash;Believe
me&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">A. <span
class="smcap">Brandram</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 24th April, the day after Borrow&rsquo;s wedding, the
Sub-Committee duly met and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Resolved that, upon mature consideration,
it does not appear to this Sub-Committee that there is, at
present, any opening for employing Mr Borrow beneficially as an
Agent of the Society . . . and that it be recommended to the
General Committee that the salary of Mr Borrow be paid up to the
10th June next.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible Society&rsquo;s valediction, which appeared in the
Thirty-Sixth Annual Report, read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;G. Borrow, Esq., one of the gentlemen
referred to in former Reports as having so zealously exerted
themselves on behalf of Spain, has just returned home, hopeless
of further attempts at present to distribute the Scriptures in
that country.&nbsp; Mr B. has succeeded, by almost incredible
pains, and at no small cost and hazard, in selling during his
last visit a few hundred copies of the Bible, and most that
remained of the edition of the New Testament printed in
Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus ended George Borrow&rsquo;s activities on behalf of the
British and Foreign Bible Society, and incidentally the seven
happiest and most active years of his life.&nbsp; On the whole
the association had been honourable to all concerned.&nbsp; There
had been moments of irritation and mistakes on both sides.&nbsp;
It would be foolish to accuse the Society of deliberately
planting obstacles in the path of its own agent; but the
unfortunate championing of Lieutenant Graydon was the result of a
very grave error of judgment.&nbsp; Borrow had no personal
friends among the Committee, to whom the impetuous zeal of
Graydon was more picturesque than the grave and deliberate
caution of Borrow.&nbsp; The Officials and Committee alike saw in
Graydon the ideal Reformer, rushing precipitately towards
martyrdom, exposing Anti-Christ as he ran.&nbsp; Had Borrow been
content to allow others to plead his cause, the history of his
relations with the Bible Society would, in all probability, have
been different.&nbsp; He felt himself a grievously injured man,
who had suffered from what he considered to be the insane antics
of another, and he was determined that Earl Street should know
it.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mr Brandram does not appear to have
understood Borrow.&nbsp; He made no attempt to humour him, to
praise him for what he had done and the way in which he had done
it.&nbsp; Praise was meat and drink to Borrow; it compensated him
for what he had endured and encouraged him to further
effort.&nbsp; He hungered for it, and when it did not come he
grew discouraged and thought that those who employed him were not
conscious of what he was suffering.&nbsp; Hence the long accounts
of what he had undergone for the Gospel&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>During his six years in Spain he had distributed nearly 5000
copies of the New Testament and 500 Bibles, also some hundreds of
the Basque and Gypsy Gospel of St Luke.&nbsp; These figures seem
insignificant beside those of Lieut. Graydon, who, on one
occasion, sold as many as 1082 volumes in fourteen days, and in
two years printed 13,000 Testaments and 3000 Bibles, distributing
the larger part of them.&nbsp; During the year 1837 he circulated
altogether between five and six thousand books.&nbsp; But there
was no comparison between the work of the two men.&nbsp; Graydon
had kept to the towns and cities on the south coast;
Borrow&rsquo;s methods were different.&nbsp; He circulated his
books largely among villages and hamlets, where the population
was sparse and the opportunities of distribution small.&nbsp; He
had gone out into the highways, risking his life at every turn,
penetrating into bandit-infested provinces in the throes of civil
war, suffering incredible hardships and fatigues and, never
sparing himself.&nbsp; Both men were earnest and eager; but the
Bible Society favoured the wrong man&mdash;at least for its
purposes.&nbsp; But for Lieut. Graydon, Borrow would in all
probability have gone to China, and what a book he would have
written, at least what letters, about the sealed East!</p>
<p>Borrow, however, had nothing to complain of.&nbsp; He had
found occupation when he badly needed it, which indirectly was to
bring him fame.&nbsp; He had been well paid for his services
(during the seven years of his employment he drew some
&pound;2300 in salary and expenses), his &pound;200 a year and
expenses (in Spain) comparing very favourably with Mr
Brandram&rsquo;s &pound;300 a year.</p>
<p>He was loyal to the Bible Society, both in word and
thought.&nbsp; He honourably kept to himself the story of the
Graydon dispute.&nbsp; He spoke of the Society with enthusiasm,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the
marrow awakes in his old bones when he thinks of what he
accomplished in Spain in the cause of religion and civilisation
with the colours of that society in his hat.&rdquo; <a
name="citation328a"></a><a href="#footnote328a"
class="citation">[328a]</a>&nbsp; In spite of the
misunderstandings and the rebukes he could write fourteen years
later that he &ldquo;bade it adieu with feelings of love and
admiration.&rdquo; <a name="citation328b"></a><a
href="#footnote328b" class="citation">[328b]</a>&nbsp; He
&ldquo;had done with Spain for ever, after doing for her all that
lay in the power of a lone man, who had never in this world
anything to depend upon, but God and his own slight
strength.&rdquo; <a name="citation328c"></a><a
href="#footnote328c" class="citation">[328c]</a>&nbsp; In the
preface to <i>The Bible in Spain</i> he pays a handsome tribute
to both Rule and Graydon, thus showing that although he was a
good hater, he could be magnanimous.</p>
<p>It has been stated that, during a portion of his association
with the Bible Society, Borrow acted as a foreign correspondent
for <i>The Morning Herald</i>.&nbsp; Dr Knapp has very
satisfactorily disproved the statement, which the Rev. Wentworth
Webster received from the Marqu&eacute;s de Santa Coloma.&nbsp;
Either the Marqu&eacute;s or Mr Webster is responsible for the
statement that Borrow was wrecked, instead of nearly wrecked, off
Cape Finisterre.&nbsp; As the Marqu&eacute;s was a passenger on
the boat, the mistake must be ascribed to Mr Webster.&nbsp; The
further statement that Borrow was imprisoned at Pamplona by
Quesada is scarcely more credible than that about the
wreck.&nbsp; His imprisonment could not very well have taken
place, as stated, in 1837&ndash;9, because General Quesada was
killed in 1836.&nbsp; Mention is made of this foreign
correspondent rumour only because it has been printed and
reprinted.&nbsp; It may be that Borrow was imprisoned at Pamplona
during the &ldquo;Veiled Period&rdquo;; there is certainly one
imprisonment (according to his own statement) unaccounted
for.&nbsp; It is curious how the fact first became impressed upon
the Marqu&eacute;s&rsquo; mind, unless he had heard it from
Borrow.&nbsp; It is quite likely that he confused the date.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to identify the two men whom Borrow
describes in <i>Lavengro</i> as being at the offices of the Bible
Society in Earl Street, when he sought to exchange for a Bible
the old Apple-woman&rsquo;s copy of <i>Moll Flanders</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One was dressed in brown,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and the
other was dressed in black; both were tall men&mdash;he who was
dressed in brown was thin, and had a particularly ill-natured
countenance; the man dressed in black was bulky, his features
were noble, but they were those of a lion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation329a"></a><a href="#footnote329a"
class="citation">[329a]</a>&nbsp; Again, in <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, he makes the man in black say with reference to the
Bible Society:&mdash;&ldquo;There is one fellow amongst them for
whom we entertain a particular aversion: a big, burly parson,
with the face of a lion, the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like
a sledge-hammer.&rdquo; <a name="citation329b"></a><a
href="#footnote329b" class="citation">[329b]</a>&nbsp; Who these
two worthies were it is impossible to say with any degree of
certainty.&nbsp; Caroline Fox describes Andrew Brandram no
further than that he &ldquo;appeared before us once more with his
shaggy eyebrows.&rdquo; <a name="citation329c"></a><a
href="#footnote329c" class="citation">[329c]</a>&nbsp; Mr
Brandram was not thin and his countenance was not
ill-natured.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
MAY 1840&ndash;MARCH 1841</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in May, Borrow, his wife and
step-daughter left London to take up their residence at Oulton,
in Suffolk.&nbsp; After years of wandering and vagabondage he was
to settle down as a landed proprietor.&nbsp; His income, or
rather his wife&rsquo;s, amounted to &pound;450 per annum, and he
must have saved a considerable sum out of the &pound;2300 he had
drawn from the Bible Society, as his mother appears to have
regarded the amounts he had sent to her as held in trust.&nbsp;
He was therefore able to instal himself, Sidi Habismilk and the
Jew of Fez upon his wife&rsquo;s small estate, with every
prospect of enjoying a period of comfort and rest after his many
years of wandering and adventure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Oulton Cottage was ideally situated on the margin of the
Broad.&nbsp; It was a one-storied building, with a dormer-attic
above, hanging &ldquo;over a lonely lake covered with wild fowl,
and girt with dark firs, through which the wind sighs sadly. <a
name="citation330a"></a><a href="#footnote330a"
class="citation">[330a]</a>&nbsp; A regular Patmos, an <i>ultima
Thule</i>; placed in an angle of the most unvisited,
out-of-the-way portion of England.&rdquo; <a
name="citation330b"></a><a href="#footnote330b"
class="citation">[330b]</a>&nbsp; A few yards from the
water&rsquo;s edge stood the famous octagonal Summer-house that
Borrow made his study.&nbsp; Here he kept his books, a veritable
&ldquo;polyglot gentleman&rsquo;s&rdquo; library, consisting of
such literary &ldquo;tools&rdquo; as a Lav-engro might be
expected to possess.&nbsp; There were also books of travel and
adventure, some chairs, a lounge and a table; whilst behind the
door hung the sword and regimental coat of the sleeping warrior
to whom his younger son had been an affliction of the spirit,
because his mind pursued paths that appeared so strangely
perilous.</p>
<p>Here in this Summer-house Borrow wrote his books.&nbsp; Here
when &ldquo;sickness was in the land, and the face of nature was
overcast&mdash;heavy rain-clouds swam in the heavens&mdash;the
blast howled amid the pines which nearly surround the lonely
dwelling, and the waters of the lake which lies before it, so
quiet in general and tranquil, were fearfully agitated,&rdquo;
Borrow shouted, &ldquo;&lsquo;Bring lights hither, O Hayim Ben
Attar, son of the miracle!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the Jew of Fez
brought in the lights,&rdquo; <a name="citation331a"></a><a
href="#footnote331a" class="citation">[331a]</a> and his master
commenced writing a book that was to make him famous.&nbsp; When
tired of writing, he would sometimes sing &ldquo;strange words in
a stentorian voice, while passers-by on the lake would stop to
listen with astonishment and curiosity to the singular
sounds.&rdquo; <a name="citation331b"></a><a href="#footnote331b"
class="citation">[331b]</a></p>
<p>Life at Oulton Cottage was delightfully simple.&nbsp; Borrow
was a good host.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am rather hospitable than
otherwise,&rdquo; <a name="citation331c"></a><a
href="#footnote331c" class="citation">[331c]</a> he wrote, and
thoroughly disliked anything in the nature of meanness.&nbsp;
There was always a bottle of wine of a rare vintage for the
honoured guest.&nbsp; Sometimes the host himself would hasten
away to the little Summer-house by the side of the Broad to muse,
his eyes fixed upon the military coat and sword, or to scribble
upon scraps of paper that, later, were to be transcribed by Mrs
Borrow.&nbsp; Borrow would spend his evenings with his wife and
Henrietta, generally in reading until bedtime.</p>
<p>In the Norwich days Borrow had formed an acquaintance with
another articled-clerk named Harvey (probably one of his
colleagues at Tuck&rsquo;s Court).&nbsp; They had kindred tastes,
in particular a love of the open air and vigorous exercise.&nbsp;
After settling at Oulton, the Borrows and the Harveys (then
living at Bury St Edmunds) became very intimate, and frequently
visited each other.&nbsp; Elizabeth Harvey, the daughter of
Borrow&rsquo;s contemporary, has given an extremely interesting
account of the home life of the Borrows.&nbsp; She has described
how sometimes Borrow would sing one of his Romany songs,
&ldquo;shake his fist at me and look quite wild.&nbsp; Then he
would ask: &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of me?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, not at all,&rsquo; I would say.&nbsp; Then he would
look just as gentle and kind, and say, &lsquo;God bless you, I
would not hurt a hair of your head.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation332a"></a><a href="#footnote332a"
class="citation">[332a]</a></p>
<p>Miss Harvey has also given us many glimpses into
Borrow&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was very fond of ghost
stories,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;and believed in the
supernatural.&rdquo; <a name="citation332b"></a><a
href="#footnote332b" class="citation">[332b]</a>&nbsp; He enjoyed
music of a lively description, one of his favourite compositions
being the well-known &ldquo;Redowa&rdquo; polka, which he would
frequently ask to have played to him again.</p>
<p>As an eater Borrow was very moderate, he &ldquo;took very
little breakfast but ate a very great quantity of dinner, and
then had only a draught of cold water before going to bed . .
.&nbsp; He was very temperate and would eat what was set before
him, often not thinking of what he was doing, and he never
refused what was offered him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation332c"></a><a href="#footnote332c"
class="citation">[332c]</a>&nbsp; On one occasion when he was
dining with the Harveys, young Harvey, seeing Borrow engrossed in
telling of his travels, handed him dish after dish in rapid
succession, from all of which he helped himself, entirely
unconscious of what he was doing.&nbsp; Finally his plate was
full to overflowing, perceiving which he became very angry, and
it was some time before he could be appeased.&nbsp; A practical
joke made no appeal to him. <a name="citation332d"></a><a
href="#footnote332d" class="citation">[332d]</a></p>
<p>Elizabeth Harvey also tells how, when a cousin of hers was
staying at Cromer, the landlady went to her one day and said,
&ldquo;O, Miss, there&rsquo;s such a curious gentleman
been.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what to think of him, I asked him
what he would like for dinner, and he said, &lsquo;Give me a
piece of flesh.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of gentleman
was it?&rdquo; enquired the cousin, and on hearing the
description recognised George Borrow, and explained that the
strange visitor merely wanted a rump-steak, a favourite dish with
him.</p>
<p>As he did not shoot or hunt, he obtained exercise either by
riding or walking.&nbsp; At times &ldquo;he suffered from
sleeplessness, when he would get up and walk to Norwich (25
miles) and return the next night recovered&rdquo; <a
name="citation333a"></a><a href="#footnote333a"
class="citation">[333a]</a> yet Borrow has said that &ldquo;he
always had the health of an elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was proud of the Church and took great pleasure in showing
to his friends the brasses it contained, including one bearing an
effigy of Sir John Fastolf, whom he considered to be the original
of Falstaff.&nbsp; He was also &ldquo;very fond of his
trees.&nbsp; He quite fretted if by some mischance he lost
one.&rdquo; <a name="citation333b"></a><a href="#footnote333b"
class="citation">[333b]</a></p>
<p>His methods with the country people round Oulton were
calculated to earn for him a reputation for queerness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Curiosity is the leading feature of my character&rdquo; <a
name="citation333c"></a><a href="#footnote333c"
class="citation">[333c]</a> he confessed, and the East Anglian
looks upon curiosity in others with marked suspicion.&nbsp; It
was impossible for Borrow to walk far without getting into
conversation with someone or other.&nbsp; He delighted in getting
people to tell their histories and experiences; &ldquo;when they
used some word peculiar to Norfolk (or Suffolk) country men, he
would say &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a Danish word.&rsquo;&nbsp; By
and bye the man would use another peculiar expression,
&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Saxon&rsquo;; a little further on
another, &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s French.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
would add, &lsquo;Why, what a wonderful man you are to speak so
many languages.&rsquo;&nbsp; One man got very angry, but Mr
Borrow was quite unconscious that he had given any
offence.&rdquo; <a name="citation334a"></a><a
href="#footnote334a" class="citation">[334a]</a></p>
<p>He took pleasure in puzzling people about languages.&nbsp;
Elizabeth Harvey tells <a name="citation334b"></a><a
href="#footnote334b" class="citation">[334b]</a> how he once put
a book before her telling her to read it, and on her saying she
could not, he replied, &ldquo;You ought; it&rsquo;s your own
language.&rdquo;&nbsp; The volume was written in Saxon.&nbsp; Yet
for all this he hated to hear foreign words introduced into
conversation.&nbsp; When he heard such adulterations of the
English language he would exclaim jocosely, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that, trying to come over me with strange languages?&rdquo; <a
name="citation334c"></a><a href="#footnote334c"
class="citation">[334c]</a></p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s first thoughts on settling down were of
literature.&nbsp; He had material for several books, as he had
informed Mr Brandram.&nbsp; Putting aside, at least for the
present, the translations of the ballads and songs, he devoted
himself to preparing for the press a book upon the Spanish
Gypsies.&nbsp; During the five years spent in Spain he had
gathered together much material.&nbsp; He had made notes in queer
places under strange and curious conditions, &ldquo;in moments
snatched from more important pursuits&mdash;chiefly in
<i>ventas</i> and <i>posad&aacute;s</i>&rdquo; <a
name="citation334d"></a><a href="#footnote334d"
class="citation">[334d]</a>&mdash;whilst engaged in distributing
the Gospel.&nbsp; It was a book of facts that he meant to write,
not theories, and if he sometimes fostered error, it was because
at the moment it was his conception of truth.&nbsp; Very little
remained to do to the manuscript.&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow had performed
her share of the work in making a fair copy for the
printer.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s subsequent remark that the
manuscript &ldquo;was written by a country amanuensis and
probably contains many ridiculous errata,&rdquo; was scarcely
gracious to the wife, who seems to have comprehended so well the
first principle of wifely duty to an illustrious and, it must be
admitted, autocratic genius&mdash;viz., self-extinction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man could endure a clever wife,&rdquo; Borrow once
confided to the unsympathetic ear of Frances Power Cobbe; but he
had married one nevertheless.&nbsp; No woman whose cleverness had
not reached the point of inspiration could have lived in intimate
association with so capricious and masterful a man as George
Borrow.&nbsp; John Hasfeldt, in sending his congratulations, had
seemed to suggest that Borrow was one of those abstruse works of
nature that require close and constant study.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
your wife thoroughly knows you,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;she will
smooth the wrinkles on your brow and you will be so cheerful and
happy that your grey hair will turn black again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In November 1840 a tall athletic gentleman in black
called upon Mr Murray, offering a manuscript for perusal and
publication.&rdquo; <a name="citation335a"></a><a
href="#footnote335a" class="citation">[335a]</a>&nbsp; Fifteen
years before, the same &ldquo;tall athletic gentleman&rdquo; had
called a dozen times at 50a Albemarle Street with translations of
Northern and Welsh ballads, but &ldquo;never could see Glorious
John.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow had determined to make another attempt
to see John Murray, and this time he was successful.&nbsp; He
submitted the manuscript of <i>The Zincali</i>, which Murray sent
to Richard Ford <a name="citation335b"></a><a
href="#footnote335b" class="citation">[335b]</a> that he might
pronounce upon it and its possibilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have made
acquaintance,&rdquo; Ford wrote to H. U. Addington, 14th Jan.
1841, &ldquo;with an extraordinary fellow, <i>George Borrow</i>,
who went out to Spain to convert the <i>gypsies</i>.&nbsp; He is
about to publish his failure, and a curious book it will
be.&nbsp; It was submitted to my perusal by the hesitating
Murray.&rdquo; <a name="citation335c"></a><a href="#footnote335c"
class="citation">[335c]</a>&nbsp; On Ford&rsquo;s advice the book
was accepted for publication, it being arranged that author and
publisher should share the profits equally between them.</p>
<p>On 17th April 1841 there appeared in two volumes <i>The
Zincali</i>; <a name="citation336a"></a><a href="#footnote336a"
class="citation">[336a]</a> <i>or</i>, <i>An Account of the
Gypsies in Spain</i>.&nbsp; <i>With an original Collection of
their Songs and Poetry</i>, <i>and a copious Dictionary of their
Language</i>.&nbsp; By George Borrow, late Agent of the British
and Foreign Bible Society in Spain.&nbsp; It was dedicated to the
Earl of Clarendon, G.C.B. (Sir George Villiers), in
&ldquo;remembrance of the many obligations under which your
Lordship has placed me, by your energetic and effectual
interference in time of need.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first edition of
750 copies sufficed to meet the demand of two years.&nbsp; Ford,
however, wrote to Murray: &ldquo;The book has created a great
sensation far and wide.&nbsp; I was sure it would, and I hope you
think that when I read the MS. my opinion and advice were
sound.&rdquo; <a name="citation336b"></a><a href="#footnote336b"

</a></p>
<p><i>The Zincali</i> had been begun at Badajos with the Romany
songs or rhymes copied down as recited by his gypsy
friends.&nbsp; To these he had subsequently added, being assisted
by a French courier, Juan Antonio Bailly, who translated the
songs into Spanish.&nbsp; These translations were originally
intended to be published in a separate work, as was the
Vocabulary, which forms part of <i>The Zincali</i>.&nbsp; Had
Borrow sought to make two separate works of the
&ldquo;Songs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vocabulary,&rdquo; there is very
considerable doubt if they would have fared any better than the
everlasting Ab Gwilym; but either with inspiration, or acting on
some one&rsquo;s wise counsel, he determined to subordinate them
to an account of the Spanish Gypsies.</p>
<p>As a piece of bookmaking <i>The Zincali</i> is by no means
notable.&nbsp; Borrow himself refers to it (page 354) as
&ldquo;this strange wandering book of mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
construction it savours rather of the method by which it was
originally inspired; but for all that it is fascinating reading,
saturated with the atmosphere of vagabondage and the gypsy
encampment.&nbsp; It was not necessarily a book for the scholar
and the philologist, many of whom scorned it on account of its
rather obvious carelessnesses and inaccuracies.&nbsp; Borrow was
not a writer of academic books.&nbsp; He lacked the instinct for
research which alone insures accuracy.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate that Borrow&rsquo;s first book
should be about the Gypsies, who had always exercised so strange
an attraction for him that he could not remember the time
&ldquo;when the very name of Gypsy did not awaken within me
feelings hard to be described.&rdquo; <a
name="citation337a"></a><a href="#footnote337a"
class="citation">[337a]</a>&nbsp; His was not merely an interest
in their strange language, their traditions, their folk-lore; it
was something nearer and closer to the people themselves.&nbsp;
They excited his curiosity, he envied their mode of life, admired
their clannishness, delighted in their primitive customs.&nbsp;
Their persistence in warring against the gentile appealed
strongly to his instinctive hatred of &ldquo;gentility
nonsense&rdquo;; and perhaps more than anything else, he envied
them the stars and the sun and the wind on the heath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romany matters have always had a peculiar interest for
me,&rdquo; <a name="citation337b"></a><a href="#footnote337b"
class="citation">[337b]</a> he affirms over and over again in
different words, and he never lost an opportunity of joining a
party of gypsies round their camp-fire.&nbsp; His knowledge of
the Romany people was not acquired from books.&nbsp; Apparently
he had read very few of the many works dealing with the
mysterious race he had singled out for his particular
attention.&nbsp; With characteristic assurance he makes the
sweeping assertion that &ldquo;all the books which have been
published concerning them [the Gypsies] have been written by
those who have introduced themselves into their society for a few
hours, and from what they have seen or heard consider themselves
competent to give the world an idea of the manners and customs of
the mysterious Romany.&rdquo; <a name="citation338a"></a><a
href="#footnote338a" class="citation">[338a]</a></p>
<p>His attitude towards the race is curious.&nbsp; He recognised
the Gypsies as liars, rogues, cheats, vagabonds, in short as the
incarnation of all the vices; yet their fascination for him in no
way diminished.&nbsp; He could mix with them, as with other
vagabonds, and not become harmed by their broad views upon
personal property, or their hundred and one tricks and
dishonesties.&nbsp; He was a changed man when in their company,
losing all that constraint that marked his intercourse with
people of his own class.</p>
<p>He had laboured hard to bring the light of the Gospel into
their lives.&nbsp; He made them translate for him the Scriptures
into their tongue; but it was the novelty of the situation, aided
by the glass of Malaga wine he gave them, not the beauty of the
Gospel of St Luke, that aroused their interest and
enthusiasm.&nbsp; To this, Borrow&rsquo;s own eyes were
open.&nbsp; &ldquo;They listened with admiration,&rdquo; he says;
&ldquo;but, alas! not of the truths, the eternal truths, I was
telling them, but to find that their broken jargon could be
written and read.&rdquo; <a name="citation338b"></a><a
href="#footnote338b" class="citation">[338b]</a></p>
<p>On one occasion, having refused to one of his congregation the
loan of two <i>barias</i> (ounces of gold), he proceeded to read
to the whole assembly instead the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the
Apostle&rsquo;s Creed in Romany.&nbsp; Happening to glance up, he
found not a gypsy in the room, but squinted, &ldquo;the Gypsy
fellow, the contriver of the jest, squinted worst of all.&nbsp;
Such are Gypsies.&rdquo; <a name="citation338c"></a><a

</a></p>
<p>It was indeed the novelty that appealed to them.&nbsp; They
greeted with a shout of exultation the reading aloud a
translation that they themselves had dictated; but they remained
unmoved by the Christian teaching it contained.&nbsp; For all
these discouragements Borrow persisted, and perhaps none of his
efforts in Spain produced less result than this &ldquo;attempt to
enlighten the minds of the Gitanos on the subject of
religion.&rdquo; <a name="citation339"></a><a href="#footnote339"
class="citation">[339]</a></p>
<p>If the Gypsies were all that is evil, judged by conventional
standards, they at least loyally stood by each other in the face
of a common foe.&nbsp; Borrow knew Ambrose Petulengro to be a
liar, a thief, in fact most things that it is desirable a man
should not be; yet he was equally sure that under no
circumstances would he forsake a friend to whom he stood
pledged.&nbsp; There seems to be little doubt that Borrow&rsquo;s
fame with the Gypsies spread throughout England and the
Continent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everybody as ever see&rsquo;d the
white-headed Romany Rye never forgot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was by no means the first Romany Rye.&nbsp; From Andrew
Boorde (15th-16th Century) down the centuries they are to be
found, even to our day, in the persons of Mr Theodore
Watts-Dunton and Mr John Sampson; but Borrow was the first to
bring the cult of Gypsyism into popularity.&nbsp; Before he
wrote, the general view of Gypsies was that they were
uncomfortable people who robbed the clothes-lines and hen-roosts,
told fortunes and incidentally intimidated the housewife if
unprotected by man or dog.&nbsp; Borrow changed all this.&nbsp;
The suspicion remained, so strongly in fact that he himself was
looked at askance for consorting with such vagabonds; but with
the suspicion was more than a spice of interest, and the Gypsies
became epitomised and immortalised in the person of Jasper
Petulengro.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s Gypsyism was as unscientific as
his &ldquo;philology.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their language, their origin
he commented on without first acquainting himself with the
literature that had gathered round their name.&nbsp; Francis
Hindes Groome, &ldquo;that perfect scholar-gypsy and
gypsy-scholar,&rdquo; wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The meagreness of his knowledge of the
Anglo-Gypsy dialect came out in his <i>Word Book of the
Romany</i> (1874); there must have been over a dozen Englishmen
who have known it far better than he.&nbsp; For his Spanish-Gypsy
vocabulary in <i>The Zincali</i> he certainly drew largely either
on Richard Bright&rsquo;s <i>Travels through Lower Hungary</i> or
on Bright&rsquo;s Spanish authority, whatever that may have
been.&nbsp; His knowledge of the strange history of the Gypsies
was very elementary, of their manners almost more so, and of
their folk-lore practically <i>nil</i>.&nbsp; And yet I would put
George Borrow above every other writer on the Gypsies.&nbsp; In
<i>Lavengro</i> and, to a less degree, in its sequel, <i>The
Romany Rye</i>, he communicates a subtle insight into Gypsydom
that is totally wanting in the works&mdash;mainly
philological&mdash;of Pott, Liebich, Paspati, Miklosich, and
their confr&egrave;res.&rdquo; <a name="citation340a"></a><a
href="#footnote340a" class="citation">[340a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Groome was by no means partial to Borrow, as a matter of fact
he openly taxed him <a name="citation340b"></a><a
href="#footnote340b" class="citation">[340b]</a> with drawing
upon Bright&rsquo;s <i>Travels in Hungary</i> (Edinburgh 1819)
for the Spanish-Romany Vocabulary, and was strong in his
denunciation of him as a <i>poseur</i>.</p>
<p>Borrow scorned book-learning.&nbsp; Writing to John Murray,
Junr. (21st Jan. 1843), about <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, he says,
&ldquo;I was conscious that there was vitality in the book and
knew that it must sell.&nbsp; I read nothing and drew entirely
from my own well.&nbsp; I have long been tired of books; I have
had enough of them,&rdquo; <a name="citation340c"></a><a
href="#footnote340c" class="citation">[340c]</a> he wrote later,
and this, taken in conjunction with another sentence, viz.,
&ldquo;My favourite, I might say my only study, is man,&rdquo; <a
name="citation340d"></a><a href="#footnote340d"
class="citation">[340d]</a> explains not only Borrow&rsquo;s
Gypsyism, but also his casual philology.&nbsp; Languages he
mostly learned that he might know men.&nbsp; In youth he
read&mdash;he had to do something during the long office hours,
and he read Danish and Welsh literature; but he did not trouble
himself much with the literary wealth of other countries, beyond
dipping into it.&nbsp; He had a brain of his own, and preferred
to form theories from the knowledge he had acquired first hand, a
most excellent thing for a man of the nature of George Borrow,
but scarcely calculated to advance learning.&nbsp; He hated
anything academic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot help thinking,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;that it was fortunate for myself, who am, to a certain
extent, a philologist, that with me the pursuit of languages has
been always modified by the love of horses . . .&nbsp; I might,
otherwise, have become a mere philologist; one of those beings
who toil night and day in culling useless words for some <i>opus
magnum</i> which Murray will never publish and nobody ever
read&mdash;beings without enthusiasm, who, having never mounted a
generous steed, cannot detect a good point in Pegasus
himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation341"></a><a href="#footnote341"
class="citation">[341]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quotation clearly explains Borrow&rsquo;s attitude
towards philology.&nbsp; As he told the
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> priest, he hoped to become something
more than a philologist.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the sale of <i>The Zincali</i> to
encourage Borrow to proceed with the other books he had partially
prepared.&nbsp; Nearly seven weeks after publication, scarcely
three hundred copies had been sold.&nbsp; In the spring of the
following year (18th March) John Murray wrote: &ldquo;The sale of
the book has not amounted to much since the first publication;
but in recompense for this the Yankees have printed two editions,
one for twenty pence <i>complete</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Borrow did
not benefit from the sale of American editions, the news was not
quite so comforting as it would have been had it referred to the
English issue.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
APRIL 1841&ndash;MARCH 1844</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> his wanderings in Portugal
and Spain Borrow had carried out his intention of keeping a
journal, from which on several occasions he sent transcriptions
to Earl Street instead of recapitulating in his letters the
adventures that befell him.&nbsp; Many of his letters went
astray, which is not strange considering the state of the
country.&nbsp; The letters and reports that Borrow wrote to the
Bible Society, which still exist, may be roughly divided as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>From his introduction until the end of the Russian
expedition</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">17.50</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Used for <i>The Bible in Spain</i></p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">30.00</p>

and not used for <i>The Bible in Spain</i></p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">100.00</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Thirty per cent, of the whole number of the letters was all
that Borrow used for <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; In addition
he had his Journal, and from these two sources he obtained all
the material he required for the book that was to electrify the
religious reading-public and make famous its writer.</p>
<p>Between Borrow and Ford a warm friendship had sprung up, and
many letters passed between them.&nbsp; Ford, who was busily
engaged upon his Hand-Book, sought Borrow&rsquo;s advice upon a
number of points, in particular about Gypsy matters.&nbsp; There
was something of the same atmosphere in his letters as in those
of John Hasfeldt: a frank, affectionate interest in Borrow and
what affected him that it was impossible to resent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How I wish you had given us more about yourself,&rdquo; he
wrote to Borrow <i>apropos</i> of <i>The Zincali</i>,
&ldquo;instead of the extracts from those blunder-headed old
Spaniards, who knew nothing about Gypsies!&nbsp; I shall give you
. . . a hint to publish your whole adventures for the last twenty
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Hayim Ben-Attar, son of the miracle, had
already brought lights, and <i>The Bible in Spain</i> had been
begun.</p>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s counsel was invariably sound and sane.&nbsp; He
advised <i>El Gitano</i>, as he sometimes called Borrow,
&ldquo;to avoid Spanish historians and <i>poetry</i> like Prussic
acid; to stick to himself, his biography and queer
adventures,&rdquo; <a name="citation343"></a><a
href="#footnote343" class="citation">[343]</a> to all of which
Borrow promised obedience.&nbsp; Ford wrote to Borrow (Feb. 1841)
suggesting that <i>The Bible in Spain</i> should be what it
actually was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am delighted to hear,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;that you meditate giving us your travels in
Spain.&nbsp; The more odd personal adventures the better, and
still more so if <i>dramatic</i>; that is, giving the exact
conversations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In June 1841 Borrow received from Earl Street the originals of
his letters to the Bible Society, and when he was eventually
called upon to return them he retained a number, either through
carelessness or by design.&nbsp; It was evidently understood that
there should be no reference to any contentious matters.&nbsp;
Borrow set to work with the aid of his &ldquo;Country
Amanuensis&rdquo; to transcribe such portions of the
correspondence as he required.&nbsp; The work proceeded
slowly.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I still scribble occasionally for want of
something better to do,&rdquo; he informs John Murray, Junr.
(23rd Aug. 1841), and continues: &ldquo; . . . A queer book will
be this same <i>Bible in Spain</i>, containing all my queer
adventures in that queer country whilst engaged in distributing
the Gospel, but neither learning, nor disquisitions, fine
writing, or poetry.&nbsp; A book with such a title and of this
description can scarcely fail of success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through a dreary summer and autumn he wrote on complaining
that there was &ldquo;scarcely a gleam of sunshine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Remote from the world &ldquo;with not the least idea of what is
going on save in my immediate neighbourhood,&rdquo; he wrote
merely to kill time.&nbsp; Such an existence was, to the last
degree, uncongenial to a man who for years had been accustomed to
sunshine and a life full of incident and adventure.</p>
<p>He grew restless and ill-content.&nbsp; He had been as free as
the wind, with occupation for brain and body.&nbsp; He was now,
like Achilles, brooding in his tent, and over his mind there fell
a shadow of unrest.&nbsp; As early as July 1841 he had thought of
settling in Berlin and devoting himself to study.&nbsp; Hasfeldt
suggested Denmark, the land of the Sagas.&nbsp; Later in the same
year Africa had presented itself to Borrow as a possible retreat,
but Ford advised him against it as &ldquo;the land from which few
travellers return,&rdquo; and told him that he had much better go
to Seville.&nbsp; Still later Constantinople was considered and
then the coast of Barbary.&nbsp; Into his letters there crept a
note of querulous complaint.&nbsp; John Hasfeldt besought him to
remember how much he had travelled and he would find that he had
wandered enough, and then he would accustom himself to rest.</p>
<p>The manuscript of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was completed
early in January (1842) and despatched to John Murray, who sent
it to Richard Ford.&nbsp; From the &ldquo;reader&rsquo;s
report&rdquo; it is to be gathered that in addition to the
manuscript Borrow sent also the letters that he had borrowed from
the Bible Society.&nbsp; Ford refers to the story of the man
stung to death by vipers <a name="citation344"></a><a
href="#footnote344" class="citation">[344]</a> &ldquo;in the
letter of the 16th August 1837,&rdquo; and advises that &ldquo;Mr
Borrow should introduce it into his narrative.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
further recommends him &ldquo;to go carefully over the whole of
his Letters, as it is very probable that other points of interest
which they contain may have been omitted in the narrative.&nbsp;
Some of the most interesting letters relate to journies not given
in the MS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work when it reached Ford was apparently in a very rough
state.&nbsp; In addition to many mistakes in spelling and
grammar, a number of words were left blank.&nbsp; In a vast
number of instances short sentences were run together.&nbsp; Mrs
Borrow does not appear to have been a very successful amanuensis
at this period.&nbsp; Perhaps the most interesting indication of
how much the manuscript, as first submitted, differed from the
published work is shown by one of Ford&rsquo;s
criticisms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the narrative there are at present two
breaks&mdash;one from about March 1836 to June 1837 [Chapters
XIII.&ndash;XX.],&mdash;and the other from November 1837 to July
1839 [Chapters XXXVI.&ndash;XLIX.]&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This represents a third of the book as finally printed.&nbsp;
Ford objected to the sudden ending; but Borrow made no alteration
in this respect.&nbsp; There were a number of other suggestions
of lesser importance in this admirable piece of technical
criticism.&nbsp; Ford disliked Borrow&rsquo;s striving to create
an air of mystery as &ldquo;taking an unwarrantable liberty with
the reader&rdquo;; he suggested a map and a short biographical
sketch of the author, and especially the nature of his connection
with the Bible Society.&nbsp; Finally he gives it as his opinion
that it is neither necessary nor advisable to insert any of his
letters to the Bible Society, either in the body of the book or
as an Appendix.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Dialogues are amongst the best parts of
the book,&rdquo; Ford wrote; &ldquo;but in several of them the
tone of the speakers, of those especially who are in humble life,
is too correct and elevated, and therefore out of
character.&nbsp; This takes away from their effect.&nbsp; I think
it would be very advisable that Mr Borrow should go over them
with reference to this point, simplifying a few of the turns of
expression and introducing a few
contractions&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;ts</i>, <i>can&rsquo;ts</i>,
etc.&nbsp; This would improve them greatly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This criticism applies to all Borrow&rsquo;s books, in
particular to the passages dealing with the Gypsies, who, in
spite of their love of high-sounding words, which they frequently
misuse, do not speak with the academic precision of
Borrow&rsquo;s works any more than do peers or princes or even
pedagogues.&nbsp; Borrow met Ford&rsquo;s criticism with the
assurance that &ldquo;the lower classes in Spain are generally
elevated in their style and scarcely ever descend to
vulgarity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s first impulse appears to have been to disregard
the suggestion that the two breaks should be filled in.&nbsp; On
13th Jan. he wrote to John Murray, Junr.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have received the MS. and likewise your
kind letter . . . Pray thank the Gentleman who perused the MS. in
my name for his suggestions, which I will attend to.&nbsp; [By
this it is clear that Borrow was not told that Ford was
&lsquo;the Gentleman.&rsquo;]&nbsp; I find that the MS. was full
of trifling mistakes, the fault of my amanuensis; but I am going
through it, and within three days shall have made all the
necessary corrections.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No man, of however sanguine a temperament, could seriously
contemplate the mere transcription of some eighty thousand words,
in addition to the correction of twice that amount of manuscript,
within three days.&nbsp; Nine days later Borrow wrote again to
John Murray, Junr.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are losing time; I have
corrected seven hundred <i>consecutive</i> pages of MS., and the
remaining two hundred will be ready in a fortnight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That he had taken so long was due to the fact that the greater
part of the preceding week had been occupied with other and more
exciting matters than correcting manuscript.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During the last week,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;I have been chiefly engaged in horse-breaking.&nbsp; A
most magnificent animal has found his way to this
neighbourhood&mdash;a half-bred Arabian&mdash;he is at present in
the hands of a low horse-dealer; he can be bought for eight
pounds, but no person will have him; it is said that he kills
everybody who mounts him.&nbsp; I have been <i>charming</i> him,
and have so far succeeded that at present he does not fling me
more than once in five minutes.&nbsp; What a contemptible trade
is the Author&rsquo;s compared to that of the jockey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not until towards the end of February that the
corrected manuscript of the first volume of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> reached Albemarle Street.&nbsp; Later and better
counsels had apparently prevailed, and Borrow had become
reconciled to filling up the breaks.</p>
<p>Borrow had other occupations than preparing his manuscript for
the printer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; He was ill and overwrought, and
small things became magnified out of all proportion to their
actual importance.&nbsp; There had been a dispute between
Borrow&rsquo;s dog and that of the rector of Oulton, the Rev. E.
P. Denniss, and as the place was small, the dogs met frequently
and renewed their feud.&nbsp; Finally the masters of the animals
became involved, and an interchange of frigid notes ensued.&nbsp;
It appears that Borrow threatened to appeal to the Law and to the
Bishop of the Diocese, and further seems to have suggested that
in the interests of peace, the rector might do away with his own
dog.&nbsp; The tone of the correspondence may be gathered from
the following notes:&mdash;<a name="citation347"></a><a
href="#footnote347" class="citation">[347]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Denniss begs to acknowledge Mr
Borrow&rsquo;s note, and is sorry to hear that his dog and Mr
Borrow&rsquo;s have again fallen out.&nbsp; Mr Denniss learns
from his servant that Mr D&rsquo;s dog was no more in fault than
Mr B&rsquo;s, which latter is of a very quarrelsome and savage
disposition, as Mr Denniss can himself testify, as well as many
other people.&nbsp; Mr Denniss regrets that these two animals
cannot agree when they meet, but he must decline acceding to Mr
Borrow&rsquo;s somewhat arbitrary demand, conceiving he has as
much right to retain a favourite, and in reality very harmless,
animal, as Mr Borrow has to keep a dog which has once bitten Mr
Denniss himself, and oftentimes attacked him and his
family.&nbsp; Mr Borrow is at perfect liberty to take any measure
he may deem advisable, either before the magistrates or the
Bishop of the Diocese, as Mr Denniss is quite prepared to meet
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oulton Rectory</span>, 22<i>nd</i>
<i>April</i> 1842.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s reply (in the rough draft found among his
papers after his death) ran:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Borrow has received Mr Denniss&rsquo;
answer to his note.&nbsp; With respect to Mr Denniss&rsquo;
recrimination on the quarrelsome disposition of his harmless
house-dog, Mr Borrow declines to say anything further.&nbsp; No
one knows better than Mr Denniss the value of his own assertions
. . . Circumstances over which Mr Borrow has at present no
control will occasionally bring him and his family under the same
roof with Mr Denniss; that roof, however, is the roof of the
House of God, and the prayers of the Church of England are
wholesome from whatever mouth they may proceed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s most partisan admirer could not excuse the
outrage to all decency contained in the last paragraph of his
note, if indeed it were ever sent, in any other way than to plead
the writer&rsquo;s ill-health.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that <i>The Bible in Spain</i> should
make its appearance in May.&nbsp; In July Borrow wrote showing
some impatience and urging greater expedition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What are your intentions with respect to
the <i>Bible in Spain</i>?&rdquo; he enquires of John
Murray.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a frank man, and frankness never
offends me.&nbsp; Has anybody put you out of conceit with the
book? . . .&nbsp; Tell me frankly and I will drink your health in
Romany.&nbsp; Or would the appearance of the <i>Bible</i> on the
first of October interfere with the avatar, first or second, of
some very wonderful lion or Divinity, to whom George Borrow, who
is <i>neither</i>, must of course give place?&nbsp; Be frank with
me, my dear Sir, and I will drink your health in Romany and
Madeira.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to offer to release John Murray from his
&ldquo;share in the agreement&rdquo; and complete the book
himself remitting to the printer &ldquo;the necessary money for
the purchase of paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Ford, who had acted as a sort of godfather to <i>The Bible
in Spain</i>, it was &ldquo;a rum, very rum, mixture of gypsyism,
Judaism, and missionary adventure,&rdquo; as he informed John
Murray.&nbsp; He read it &ldquo;with great delight,&rdquo; and
its publisher may &ldquo;depend upon it that the book will sell,
which, after all, is the rub.&rdquo;&nbsp; He liked the
sincerity, the style, the effect of incident piling on
incident.&nbsp; It reminded him of <i>Gil Blas</i> with a touch
of Bunyan.&nbsp; Borrow is &ldquo;such a <i>trump</i> . . . as
full of meat as an egg, and a fresh-laid one.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
this he tells John Murray, and concludes with the assurance,
&ldquo;Borrow will lay you golden eggs, and hatch them after the
ways of Egypt; put salt on his tail and secure him in your coop,
and beware how any poacher coaxes him with &lsquo;raisins&rsquo;
or reasons out of the Albemarle preserve.&rdquo; <a
name="citation349"></a><a href="#footnote349"
class="citation">[349]</a></p>
<p>Ford was never tired of applying new adjectives to Borrow and
his work.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;an extraordinary fellow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;this wild missionary,&rdquo; &ldquo;a queer
chap.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow, on the other hand, cherished a sincere
regard for the man who had shown such enthusiasm for his
work.&nbsp; To John Murray, Junr., he wrote (4th April 1843):
&ldquo;Pray remember me to Ford, who is no humbug and is one of
the few beings that I care something about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout his correspondence with Borrow, Richard Ford showed
a judgment and an appreciation of what the public would be likely
to welcome that stamped him as a publishers&rsquo;
&ldquo;reader&rdquo; by instinct.&nbsp; Such advice as he gave to
Borrow in the following letter set up a standard of what a book,
such as Borrow had it in his power to write, actually should
be.&nbsp; It unquestionably influenced Borrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">10<i>th</i> <i>June</i>
1842.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice again and again is to avoid all fine writing,
all descriptions of mere scenery and trivial events.&nbsp; What
the world wants are racy, real, genuine scenes, and the more out
of the way the better.&nbsp; Poetry is utterly to be
avoided.&nbsp; If Apollo were to come down from Heaven, John
Murray would not take his best manuscript as a gift.&nbsp; Stick
to yourself, to what you have seen, and the people you have mixed
with.&nbsp; The more you give us of odd Jewish people the better
. . .&nbsp; Avoid words, stick to deeds.&nbsp; Never think of how
you express yourself; for good matter must tell, and no fine
writing will make bad matter good.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid
that what you may not think good will not be thought so by
others.&nbsp; It often happens just the reverse . . . New facts
seen in new and strange countries will please everybody; but old
scenery, even Cintra, will not.&nbsp; We know all about that, and
want something that we do not know . . . The grand thing is to be
bold and to avoid the common track of the silver paper, silver
fork, blue-stocking.&nbsp; Give us adventure, wild adventure,
journals, thirty language book, sorcery, Jews, Gentiles, rambles,
and the interior of Spanish prisons&mdash;the way you get in, the
way you get out.&nbsp; No author has yet given us a Spanish
prison.&nbsp; Enter into the iniquities, the fees, the slang,
etc.&nbsp; It will be a little &agrave; la Thurtell, but you see
the people like to have it so.&nbsp; Avoid rant and cant.&nbsp;
Dialogues always tell; they are dramatic and give an air of
reality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Bible in Spain</i> was published 10th December, and one
of the first copies that reached him was inscribed by the author
to &ldquo;Ann Borrow.&nbsp; With her son&rsquo;s best love, 13th
Decr. 1842.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the critics there was praise and scarcely anything but
praise.&nbsp; It was received as a work bearing the unmistakable
stamp of genius.&nbsp; Lockhart himself reviewed it in <i>The
Quarterly Review</i>, confessing the shame he felt at not having
reviewed <i>The Zincali</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very good&mdash;very
clever&mdash;very neatly done.&nbsp; Only one fault to
find&mdash;too laudatory,&rdquo; was Borrow&rsquo;s comment upon
this notice.</p>
<p>And through the clamour and din of it all, old Mrs Borrow
wrote to her daughter-in-law telling her of the call of an old
friend, whom she had not seen for twenty-eight years, and who had
come to talk with her of the fame of her son, &ldquo;the most
remarkable man that Dereham ever produced.&nbsp; Capt. Girling is
a man of few words, but when he <i>do</i> speak it is to some
purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford wrote also (he was always writing
impulsive, boyish letters) telling how Borrow&rsquo;s name would
&ldquo;fill the trump of fame,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Murray is
in high bone&rdquo; about the book.&nbsp; Hasfeldt wrote, too,
saying that he saw his &ldquo;friend &lsquo;tall George,&rsquo;
wandering over the mountains until I ached in every joint with
the vividness of his descriptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all this chorus of praise there was the complaint of the
<i>Dublin Review</i> that &ldquo;Borrow was a missionary sent out
by a gang of conspirators against Christianity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s comment upon this notice was that &ldquo;It is
easier to call names and misquote passages in a dirty Review than
to write <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second edition of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was issued in
January, to which the author contributed a preface, &ldquo;very
funny, but wild,&rdquo; he assured John Murray, Junr., and he
promised &ldquo;yet another preface for the third edition, should
one be called for.&rdquo;&nbsp; The third edition appeared in
March, the fourth in June, and the fifth in July.&nbsp; When the
Fourth Edition was nearing completion Borrow wrote to Murray:
&ldquo;Would it be as well to write a preface to this
<i>fourth</i> edition with a tirade or two against the Pope, and
allusions to the Great North Road?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Murray
replied, &ldquo;With due submission to you as author, I would
suggest that you should not abuse the Pope in the new
preface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the flush of his success Borrow could afford to laugh at
the few cavilling critics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let them call me a nonentity if they
will,&rdquo; he wrote to John Murray, Junr. (13th March).&nbsp;
&ldquo;I believe that some of those, who say I am a phantom,
would alter their tone provided they were to ask me to a good
dinner; bottles emptied and fowls devoured are not exactly the
feats of a phantom.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I partake more of the nature
of a Brownie or Robin Goodfellow, goblins, &rsquo;tis true, but
full of merriment and fun, and fond of good eating and
drinking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America echoed back the praise and bought the book in
thousands.&nbsp; Publishers issued editions in Philadelphia and
New York; but Borrow did not participate in the profits, as there
was then no copyright protection for English books in the United
States of America.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> reported (27th
May 1843) that 30,000 copies had been sold in America.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I really never heard of anything so infamous,&rdquo; wrote
Borrow to his wife.&nbsp; The only thing that America gave him
was praise and (in common with other countries) a place in its
biographical dictionaries and encyclop&aelig;dias.&nbsp; <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> was translated into French and German and
subsequently (abridged) into Russian.</p>
<p>What appeared to please Borrow most was Sir Robert
Peel&rsquo;s reference to him in the House of Commons, although
he regretted the scanty report of the speech given in the
newspapers.&nbsp; Replying to Dr Bowring&rsquo;s (at that time
Borrow&rsquo;s friend) motion &ldquo;for copies of the
correspondence of the British Government with the Porte on the
subject of the Bishop of Jerusalem,&rdquo; Sir Robert remarked:
&ldquo;If Mr Borrow had been deterred by trifling obstacles, the
circulation of the Bible in Spain would never have been advanced
to the extent which it had happily attained.&nbsp; If he had not
persevered he would not have been the agent of so much
enlightment.&rdquo; <a name="citation352"></a><a
href="#footnote352" class="citation">[352]</a></p>
<p>There were many things that contributed to the instantaneous
success of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; Apart from the vivid
picture that it gave of the indomitable courage and iron
determination of a man commanding success, its literary
qualities, and enthralling interest, its greatest commercial
asset lay in its appeal to the Religious Public.&nbsp; Never,
perhaps, had they been invited to read such a book, because never
had the Bible been distributed by so amazing a missionary as
George Borrow.&nbsp; <i>Gil Blas</i> with a touch of Bunyan, as
Ford delightfully phrased it, and not too much Bunyan.&nbsp;
Thieves, murderers, gypsies, bandits, prisons, wars&mdash;all
knit together by the missionary work of a man who was <i>persona
grata</i> with every lawless ruffian he encountered, and yet a
sower of the seed.&nbsp; The Religious Public did not pause to
ponder over the strangeness of the situation.&nbsp; They had
fallen among thieves, and with breathless eagerness were prepared
to enjoy to the full the novel experience.</p>
<p>Here was a religious book full of the most exquisite material
thrills without a suggestion of a spiritual moral.&nbsp;
Criminals were encountered, their deeds rehearsed and the
customary sermon upon the evils arising from wickedness
absent.&nbsp; It was a stimulating drink to unaccustomed
palates.&nbsp; <i>The Bible in Spain</i> sold in its
thousands.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the book has never been questioned; if it had,
Borrow&rsquo;s letters to the Bible Society would immediately
settle any doubt that might arise.&nbsp; If there be one incident
in the work that appears invented, it is the story of Benedict
Moll, the treasure-hunter; yet even that is authentic.&nbsp; In
the following letter, dated 22nd June 1839, Rey Rom&eacute;ro,
the bookseller of Santiago, refers to the unfortunate Benedict
Moll:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The German of the <i>Treasure</i>,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;came here last year bearing letters from the
Government for the purpose of discovering it.&nbsp; But, a few
days after his arrival, they threw him into prison; from thence
he wrote me, making himself known as the one you introduced to
me; wherefore my son went to see him in prison.&nbsp; He told my
son that you also had been arrested, but I could not credit
it.&nbsp; A short time after, they took him off to Coru&ntilde;a;
then they brought him back here again, and I do not know what has
become of him since.&rdquo; <a name="citation353"></a><a
href="#footnote353" class="citation">[353]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow now became the lion of the hour.&nbsp; He was
f&ecirc;ted and feasted in London, and everybody wanted to meet
the wonderful white-haired author of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>.&nbsp; One day he is breakfasting with the Prussian
Ambassador, &ldquo;with princes and members of Parliament, I was
the star of the morning,&rdquo; he writes to his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought to myself &lsquo;what a
difference!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Later he was present at a grand
<i>soir&eacute;e</i>, &ldquo;and the people came in throngs to be
introduced to me.&nbsp; To-night,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;I
am going to the Bishop of Norwich, to-morrow to another place,
and so on.&rdquo; <a name="citation354"></a><a
href="#footnote354" class="citation">[354]</a></p>
<p>Borrow had been much touched by the news of the death of Allan
Cunningham (1785&ndash;1842).</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Only think, poor Allan Cunningham
dead!&rdquo; he wrote to John Murray, Junr. (25th Nov.
1842).&nbsp; &ldquo;A young man&mdash;only
fifty-eight&mdash;strong and tall as a giant; might have lived to
a hundred and one, but he bothered himself about the affairs of
this world far too much.&nbsp; That statue shop was his bane;
took to book making likewise, in a word too fond of
Mammon&mdash;awful death&mdash;no preparation&mdash;came
literally upon him like a thief in the dark.&nbsp; Am thinking of
writing a short life of him; old friend&mdash;twenty years&rsquo;
standing, knew a good deal about him; <i>Traditional Tales</i>
his best work . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray send Dr Bowring a copy of Bible.&nbsp; Lives No.
1, Queen Square, Westminster, another old friend.&nbsp; Send one
to Ford&mdash;capital fellow.&nbsp; Respects to Mr M.&nbsp; God
bless you.&nbsp; Feel quite melancholy, Ever yours.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these Jinglelike periods Borrow pays tribute to the man who
praised his Romantic Ballads and contributed a prefatory
poem.&nbsp; He returned to the subject ten days later in another
letter to John Murray, Junr.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get poor
Allan out of my head,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I come
up I intend to go and see his wife.&nbsp; What a
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fame did not dispel from Borrow&rsquo;s mind the old
restlessness, the desire for action.&nbsp; He was still unwell,
worried at the sight of &ldquo;Popery . . . springing up in every
direction . . . <i>There&rsquo;s no peace in this
world</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation355a"></a><a
href="#footnote355a" class="citation">[355a]</a>&nbsp; A cold
contracted by his wife distressed him to the point of complaining
that &ldquo;there is little but trouble in this world; I am
nearly tired of it.&rdquo; <a name="citation355b"></a><a
href="#footnote355b" class="citation">[355b]</a>&nbsp; Exercise
failed to benefit him.&nbsp; He was suffering from languor and
nervousness.&nbsp; And through it all that Spartan woman who had
committed the gravest of matrimonial errors, that of marrying a
genius, soothed and comforted the sick lion, tired even of
victory.</p>
<p>Small things troubled him and honours awakened in him no
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> in reviewing <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> had inferred that he was not a member of the Church of
England, <a name="citation355c"></a><a href="#footnote355c"
class="citation">[355c]</a> and the statement &ldquo;must be
contradicted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Royal Institution was prepared to
confer an honour upon him, and he could not make up his mind
whether or not to accept it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What would the Institute expect me to
write?&rdquo; he enquires of John Murray, Junr., 25th Feb.
1843.&nbsp; &ldquo;(I have exhausted Spain and the
Gypsies.)&nbsp; Would an essay on the Welsh language and
literature suit, with an account of the Celtic tongues?&nbsp; Or
would something about the ancient North and its literature be
more acceptable? . . . Had it been the Royal Academy, I should
have consented at once, and do hereby empower you to accept in my
name any offer which may be made from that quarter.&nbsp; I
should very much like to become an Academician, the thing would
just suit me, more especially as &lsquo;they do not want
<i>clever</i> men, but <i>safe</i> men.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now I am
safe enough, ask the Bible Society, whose secrets I have kept so
much to their satisfaction, that they have just accepted at my
hands an English Gypsy Gospel <i>gratis</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation356"></a><a href="#footnote356"
class="citation">[356]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He declined an invitation to join the Ethnological
Society.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he enquires in the
same letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;At present I am in great demand.&nbsp;
A Bishop has just requested me to visit him.&nbsp; The worst of
these Bishops is that they are all skinflints, saving for their
families; their <i>cuisine</i> is bad and their Port-wine
execrable, and as for their cigars&mdash;. . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow strove to quiet his spirit by touring about Norfolk,
&ldquo;putting up at dead of night in country towns and small
villages.&rdquo;&nbsp; He returned to Oulton at the end of a
fortnight, having tired himself and knocked up his horse.&nbsp;
Even the news that a new edition of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was
required could not awaken in him any enthusiasm.&nbsp; He was
glad the book had sold, as he knew it would, and he would like a
rough estimate of the profits.&nbsp; A few days later he writes
to John Murray, Junr., with reference to a new edition of <i>The
Zincali</i>, saying that he finds &ldquo;that there is far more
connection between the first and second volumes than he had
imagined,&rdquo; and begging that the reprint may be the same as
the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would take nearly a month to refashion
the book,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;and I believe a
month&rsquo;s mental labour at the present time would do me
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The weather in particular affected, him.&nbsp;
For years he had been accustomed to sun-warmed Spain, and the
gloom and greyness of England depressed him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Strange weather this,&rdquo; he had written
to John Murray (31st Dec. 1842)&mdash;&ldquo;very unwholesome I
believe both for man and beast.&nbsp; Several people dead and
great mortality amongst the cattle.&nbsp; Am intolerably well
myself, but get but little rest&mdash;disagreeable
dreams&mdash;digestion not quite so good as I could
wish&mdash;been on the water system&mdash;won&rsquo;t
do&mdash;have left it off, and am now taking lessons in
singing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many men have earned the reputation of madness for less
eccentric actions than taking lessons in singing as a cure for
indigestion, after the failure of the water cure.</p>
<p>Although he was receiving complimentary letters from all
quarters and from people he had never even heard of, he seemed
acutely unhappy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I did wrong,&rdquo; he writes to his wife
from London (29th May 1843), &ldquo;not to bring you when I came,
for without you I cannot get on at all.&nbsp; Left to myself, a
gloom comes upon me which I cannot describe.&nbsp; I will
endeavour to be home on Thursday, as I wish so much to be with
you, without whom there is no joy for me nor rest.&nbsp; You tell
me to ask for <i>situations</i>, etc.&nbsp; I am not at all
suited for them.&nbsp; My place seems to be in our own dear
cottage, where, with your help, I hope to prepare for a better
world . . . I dare say I shall be home on Thursday, perhaps
earlier, if I am unwell; for the poor bird when in trouble has no
one to fly to but his mate.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a few days later:
&ldquo;I wish I had not left home.&nbsp; Take care of
yourself.&nbsp; Kiss poor Hen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his stay in London, Borrow sat to Henry Wyndham
Phillips, R.A., for his portrait. <a name="citation357"></a><a
href="#footnote357" class="citation">[357]</a>&nbsp; On 21st June
John Murray wrote: &ldquo;I have seen your portrait.&nbsp;
Phillips is going to saw off a bit of the panel, which will give
you your proper and characteristic height.&nbsp; Next year you
will doubtless cut a great figure in the Exhibition.&nbsp; It is
the best thing young Phillips has done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The painting
was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1844 as &ldquo;George
Borrow, Esq., author of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>,&rdquo; and is
now in the possession of Mr John Murray.</p>
<p>There is a story told in connection with the painting of this
portrait.&nbsp; Borrow was a bad sitter, and visibly chafed at
remaining indoors doing nothing.&nbsp; To overcome this
restlessness the painter had recourse to a clever
stratagem.&nbsp; He enquired of his sitter if Persian were really
a fine language, as he had heard; Borrow assured him that it was,
and at Phillips&rsquo; request, started declaiming at the top of
his voice, his eyes flashing with enthusiasm.&nbsp; When he
ceased, the wily painter mentioned other tongues, Turkish,
Armenian, etc., in each instance with the same result, and the
painting of the portrait became an easy matter.</p>
<p>On 23rd June John Murray (the Second) died, at the age of
sixty-five, and was succeeded by his son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor old
Murray!&rdquo; Ford wrote to Borrow, &ldquo;We shall never see
his like again.&nbsp; He . . . was a fine fellow in every
respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another letter he refers to him as
&ldquo;that Prince of Bibliophiles, poor, dear, old
Murray.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s own relations with John
Murray had always been most cordial.&nbsp; On one occasion, when
writing to his son, he says: &ldquo;I shall be most happy to see
you and still more your father, whose jokes do one good.&nbsp; I
wish all the world were as gay as he.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then without a
break, he goes on to deplore the fact that &ldquo;a gentleman
drowned himself last week on my property.&nbsp; I wish he had
gone somewhere else.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was George Borrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>For some time past Borrow&rsquo;s thoughts had been directed
towards obtaining a Government post abroad.&nbsp; The sentence,
&ldquo;You tell me to ask for situations, etc.,&rdquo; in a
letter to his wife had reference to this ambition.&nbsp; He had
previously (21st June 1841) written to Lord Clarendon suggesting
for himself a consulship; but the reply had not been
encouraging.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;quite hopeless to expect a
consulship from Lord Palmerston, the applicants were too many and
the appointments too few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow recognised the stagnation of his present life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish the Government would give me some
command in Ireland which would call forth my energies,&rdquo; he
wrote to John Murray (25th Oct. 1843).&nbsp; &ldquo;If there be
an outbreak there I shall apply to them at once, for my heart is
with them in the present matter: I hope they will be firm, and
they have nothing to fear; I am sure that the English nation will
back them, for the insolence and ingratitude of the Irish, and
the cowardice of their humbug chief, have caused universal
disgust.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later he wrote, also to John Murray, with
reference to that &ldquo;trumpery fellow O&rsquo;Connell . . . I
wish I were acquainted with Sir Robert Peel.&nbsp; I could give
him many a useful hint with respect to Ireland and the
Irish.&nbsp; I know both tolerably well.&nbsp; Whenever
there&rsquo;s a row I intend to go over with Sidi Habismilk and
put myself at the head of a body of volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had previously written &ldquo;the old Duke [Wellington]
will at last give salt eel to that cowardly, bawling vagabond
O&rsquo;Connell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow detested O&rsquo;Connell as
a &ldquo;Dublin bully . . . a humbug, without courage or one
particle of manly feeling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again (17th June) he had
written: &ldquo;Horrible news from Ireland.&nbsp; I wish
sincerely the blackguards would break out at once; they will
never be quiet until they have got a sound licking, and the
sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The finer side of Borrow&rsquo;s character was shown in his
eagerness to obtain employment.&nbsp; There is a touch of pathos
in the sight of this knight, armed and ready to fight anything
for anybody, wasting his strength and his talents in feuds with
his neighbours.</p>
<p>In the profits on the old and the preparation of new editions
of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, Borrow took a keen interest.&nbsp;
The money he was making enabled him to assist his wife in
disembarrassing her estate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I begin to take
considerable pleasure in making money,&rdquo; he wrote to his
publisher, &ldquo;which I hope is a good sign; for what is life
unless we take pleasure in something?&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he
enquires, &ldquo;Why does not the public call for another edition
of them [<i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>].&nbsp; You see what an
unconscionable rascal I am becoming.&rdquo;&nbsp; During his
lifetime Borrow received from the firm of Murray, &pound;3437,
19s., most of which was on account of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>
and, consequently, was paid to him during the first years of his
association with Albemarle Street.</p>
<p>Caroline Fox gives an interesting picture of Borrow at this
period as he appeared to her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;25<i>th</i>
<i>Oct.</i> 1843.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine Gurney gave us a note to George Borrow, so on
him we called,&mdash;a tall, ungainly, uncouth man, with great
physical strength, a quick penetrating eye, a confident manner,
and a disagreeable tone and pronunciation.&nbsp; He was sitting
on one side of the fire, and his old mother on the other.&nbsp;
His spirits always sink in wet weather, and to-day was very
rainy, but he was courteous and not displeased to be a little
lionised, for his delicacy is not of the most susceptible.&nbsp;
He talked about Spain and the Spaniards; the lowest classes of
whom, he says, are the only ones worth investigating, the upper
and middle class being (with exceptions, of course) mean,
selfish, and proud beyond description.&nbsp; They care little for
Roman Catholicism, and bear faint allegiance to the Pope.&nbsp;
They generally lead profligate lives, until they lose all energy
and then become slavishly superstitious.&nbsp; He said a curious
thing of the Esquimaux, namely, that their language is a most
complex and highly artificial one, calculated to express the most
delicate metaphysical subtleties, yet they have no literature,
nor are there any traces of their ever having had one&mdash;a
most curious anomaly; hence he simply argues that you can ill
judge of a people by their language.&rdquo; <a
name="citation360a"></a><a href="#footnote360a"
class="citation">[360a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the strangest things about Borrow&rsquo;s personality
was that it almost invariably struck women unfavourably.&nbsp;
That he himself was not indifferent to women is shown by the
impression made upon him by the black eyes of one of the Misses
Mills of Saxham Hall, where he was taken to dinner by Dr Hake,
who states that &ldquo;long afterwards, his inquiries after the
black eyes were unfailing.&rdquo; <a name="citation360b"></a><a
href="#footnote360b" class="citation">[360b]</a>&nbsp; He was
also very kind and considerate to women.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was very
polite and gentlemanly in ladies&rsquo; society, and we all liked
him,&rdquo; wrote one woman friend <a name="citation360c"></a><a
href="#footnote360c" class="citation">[360c]</a> who frequently
accompanied him on his walks.&nbsp; She has described him as
walking along &ldquo;singing to himself or quite silent, quite
forgetting me until he came to a high hill, when he would turn
round, seize my hand, and drag me up.&nbsp; Then he would sit
down and enjoy the prospect.&rdquo; <a name="citation360d"></a><a
href="#footnote360d" class="citation">[360d]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
MARCH 1844&ndash;1848</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> March 1844 Borrow, unable longer
to control the <i>Wanderlust</i> within him, gave up the
struggle, and determined to make a journey to the East.&nbsp; He
was in London on the 20th, as Lady Eastlake (then Miss Elizabeth
Rigby) testifies in her Journal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Borrow came in the
evening,&rdquo; she writes: &ldquo;now a fine man, but a most
disagreeable one; a kind of character that would be most
dangerous in rebellious times&mdash;one that would suffer or
persecute to the utmost.&nbsp; His face is expressive of
wrong-headed determination.&rdquo; <a name="citation361"></a><a
href="#footnote361" class="citation">[361]</a></p>
<p>He left London towards the end of April for Paris, from which
he wrote to John Murray, 1st May:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vidocq wishes very much to have a copy of
my <i>Gypsies of Spain</i>, and likewise one of the Romany
Gospels.&nbsp; On the other side you will find an order on the
Bible Society for the latter, and perhaps you will be so kind as
to let one of your people go to Earl Street to procure it.&nbsp;
You would oblige me by forwarding it to your agent in Paris, the
address is Monsr. Vidocq, Galerie Vivienne, No. 13 . . . V. is a
strange fellow, and amongst other things dabbles in
literature.&nbsp; He is meditating a work upon <i>Les
Bohemiens</i>, about whom I see he knows nothing at all.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that the <i>Zincali</i>, were it to fall into his
hands, would be preciously gutted, and the best part of the
contents pirated.&nbsp; By the way, could you not persuade some
of the French publishers to cause it to be translated, in which
event there would be no fear.&nbsp; Such a work would be sure to
sell.&nbsp; I wish Vidocq to have a copy of the book, but I
confess I have my suspicions; he is so extraordinarily
civil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Paris he proceeded to Vienna, and thence into Hungary and
Transylvania, where he remained for some months.&nbsp; He is
known to have been &ldquo;in the steppe of Debreczin,&rdquo; <a
name="citation362a"></a><a href="#footnote362a"
class="citation">[362a]</a> to Koloszvar, through Nagy-Szeben, or
Hermannstadt, on his journey through Roumania to Bucharest.&nbsp;
He visited Wallachia &ldquo;for the express purpose of
discoursing with the Gypsies, many of whom I found wandering
about.&rdquo; <a name="citation362b"></a><a href="#footnote362b"
class="citation">[362b]</a></p>
<p>So little is known of Borrow&rsquo;s Eastern Journey that the
following account, given by an American, has a peculiar
interest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My companions, as we rode along, related
some marvellous stories of a certain English traveller who had
been here [near Grosswardein] and of his influence over the
Gypsies.&nbsp; One of them said that he was walking out with him
one day, when they met a poor gypsy woman.&nbsp; The Englishman
addressed her in Hungarian, and she answered in the usual
disdainful way.&nbsp; He changed his language, however, and spoke
a word or two in an unknown tongue.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s face
lighted up in an instant, and she replied in the most passionate,
eager way, and after some conversation dragged him away almost
with her.&nbsp; After this the English gentleman visited a number
of their most private gatherings and was received everywhere as
one of them.&nbsp; He did more good among them, all said, than
all the laws over them, or the benevolent efforts for them, of
the last half century.&nbsp; They described his
appearance&mdash;his tall, lank, muscular form, and mentioned
that he had been much in Spain, and I saw that it must be that
most ubiquitous of travellers, Mr Borrow.&rdquo; <a
name="citation362c"></a><a href="#footnote362c"
class="citation">[362c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the fame most congenial to Borrow&rsquo;s strange
nature.&nbsp; Dinners, receptions, and the like caused him to
despise those who found pleasure in such &ldquo;crazy admiration
for what they called gentility.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was his foible,
as much as &ldquo;gentility nonsense&rdquo; was theirs, to find
pleasure in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the mysterious stranger, who
by a word could change a disdainful gypsy into a fawning,
awe-stricken slave.&nbsp; Fame to satisfy George Borrow must
carry with it something of the greatness of Olympus.</p>
<p>A glimpse of Borrow during his Eastern tour is obtained from
Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s letters to John Murray.&nbsp; After telling
him that she possesses a privilege which many wives do not
(viz.), permission to open her Husband&rsquo;s letters during his
absence, she proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The accounts from him are, I am thankful to
say, very satisfactory.&nbsp; It is extraordinary with what marks
of kindness even Catholics of distinction treat him when they
know who he is, but it is clearly his gift of tongues which
causes him to meet with so many adventures, several of which he
has recorded of a most singular nature.&rdquo; <a
name="citation363"></a><a href="#footnote363"
class="citation">[363]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Vienna Borrow had arranged to wait until he should receive
a letter from his wife, &ldquo;being very anxious to know of his
family,&rdquo; as Mrs Borrow informed John Murray (24th
July).</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus far,&rdquo; she continues,
&ldquo;thanks be to God, he has prospered in his journey.&nbsp;
Many and wonderful are the adventures he has met with, which I
hope at no distant period may be related to his friends.&nbsp;
Doctor Bowring was very kind in sending me flattering tidings of
my Husband.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was at Constantinople on 17th Sept. when he drew on his
letter of credit.&nbsp; Leland tells an anecdote about Borrow at
Constantinople; but it must be remembered that it was written
when he regarded Borrow with anything but friendly
feelings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir Patrick Colquhoun told me that once
when he was at Constantinople, Mr Borrow came there, and gave it
out that he was a marvellous Oriental scholar.&nbsp; But there
was great scepticism on this subject at the Legation, and one day
at the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, where the great writer
and divers young diplomatists dined, two who were seated on
either side of Borrow began to talk Arabic, speaking to him, the
result being that he was obliged to confess that he not only did
not understand what they were saying, but did not even know what
the language was.&nbsp; Then he was tried in Modern Greek, with
the same result.&rdquo; <a name="citation364"></a><a
href="#footnote364" class="citation">[364]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story is obviously untrue.&nbsp; Had Borrow been ignorant
of Arabic he would not have risked writing to Dr Bowring (11th
Sept. 1831; see <i>ante</i>, page 85) expressing his enthusiasm
for that language.&nbsp; Arabic had, apparently, formed one of
the subjects of his preliminary examination at Earl Street.&nbsp;
With regard to Modern Greek he confessed in a letter to Mr
Brandram (12th June 1839), &ldquo;though I speak it very ill, I
can make myself understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having obtained a Turkish passport, and after being presented
to Abd&ucirc;l Medj&icirc;d, the Sultan, Borrow proceeded to
Salonika and, crossing Thessaly to Albania, visited Janina and
Prevesa.&nbsp; He passed over to Corf&ugrave;, and saw Venice and
Rome, returning to England by way of Marseilles, Paris and
Havre.&nbsp; He arrived in London on 16th November, after nearly
seven months&rsquo; absence, to find his &ldquo;home particularly
dear to me . . . after my long wanderings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is curious that he should have left no record of this
expedition; but if he made notes he evidently destroyed them, as,
with the exception of a few letters, nothing was found among his
papers relating to the Eastern tour.&nbsp; There is evidence that
he was occupied with his pen during this journey, in the
existence at the British Museum of his <i>Vocabulary of the Gypsy
Language as spoken in Hungary and Transylvania</i>, <i>compiled
during an intercourse of some months with the Gypsies in those
parts in the year</i> 1844, <i>by George Borrow</i>.&nbsp; In all
probability he prepared his <i>Bohemian Grammar</i> at the same
time. <a name="citation365a"></a><a href="#footnote365a"
class="citation">[365a]</a></p>
<p>From the time that he became acquainted with Borrow, Richard
Ford had constituted himself the genius of <i>La Mezquita</i>
(the Mosque), as he states the little octagonal Summer-house was
called.&nbsp; He was for ever urging in impulsive, polyglot
letters that the curtain to be lifted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Publish your
<i>whole</i> adventures for the last twenty years,&rdquo; he had
written. <a name="citation365b"></a><a href="#footnote365b"
class="citation">[365b]</a>&nbsp; Ford saw that a man of
Borrow&rsquo;s nature must have had astonishing adventures, and
with <i>his</i> pen would be able to tell them in an astonishing
manner.</p>
<p>As early as the summer of 1841 Borrow appears to have
contemplated writing his <i>Autobiography</i>.&nbsp; On the eve
of the appearance of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> (17th Dec.) he
wrote to John Murray: &ldquo;I hope our book will be successful;
if so, I shall put another on the stocks.&nbsp; Capital subject:
early life; studies and adventures; some account of my father,
William Taylor, Whiter, Big Ben, etc. etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first draft of notes for <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>an
Autobiography</i>, as the book was originally advertised in the
announcement, is extremely interesting.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Reasons for studying languages: French,
Italian, D&rsquo;Eterville.</p>
<p>Southern tongues.&nbsp; Dante.</p>
<p>Walks.&nbsp; The Quaker&rsquo;s Home, Mousehold.&nbsp;
Petulengro.</p>
<p>The Gypsies.</p>
<p>The Office.&nbsp; Welsh.&nbsp; Lhuyd.</p>
<p>German.&nbsp; Levy.&nbsp; Billy Taylor.</p>
<p>Danish.&nbsp; K&oelig;mpe Viser.&nbsp; Billy Taylor.&nbsp;
Dinner.</p>
<p>Bowring.</p>
<p>Hebrew.&nbsp; The Jew.</p>
<p>Philosophy.&nbsp; Radicalism.&nbsp; Ranters.</p>
<p>Thurtell.&nbsp; Boxers.&nbsp; Petulengres.&rdquo; <a
name="citation365c"></a><a href="#footnote365c"
class="citation">[365c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> was planned in 1842 and the greater part
written before the end of the following year, although the work
was not actually completed until 1846.&nbsp; There are numerous
references in Borrow&rsquo;s letters of this period to the book
on which he was then engaged, and he invariably refers to it as
his <i>Life</i>.&nbsp; On 21st January 1843 he writes to John
Murray, Junr.: &ldquo;I meditate shortly a return to Barbary in
quest of the <i>Witch Hamlet</i>, and my adventures in the land
of wonders will serve capitally to fill the thin volume of <i>My
Life</i>, <i>a Drama</i>, By G. B.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again and again
Borrow refers to <i>My Life</i>.&nbsp; Hasfeldt and Ford also
wrote of it as the &ldquo;wonderful life&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
<i>Biography</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his letters to John Murray, Borrow not only refers to the
book as his <i>Life</i>, but from time to time gives crumbs of
information concerning its progress.&nbsp; The Secretary of the
Bible Society has just lent him his letters from Russia,
&ldquo;which will be of great assistance in the Life, as I shall
work them up as I did those relating to Spain.&nbsp; The first
volume,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;will be devoted to England
entirely, and my pursuits and adventures in early
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He recognises that he must be careful of the
reputation that he has earned.&nbsp; His new book is to be
original, as would be seen when it at last appears; but he
confesses that occasionally he feels &ldquo;tremendously
lazy.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion (27th March 1843) he
writes to John Murray, Junr.: &ldquo;I hope by the end of next
year that I shall have part of my life ready for the press in 3
vols.&rdquo;&nbsp; Six months later (2nd Oct. 1843) he writes to
John Murray:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish I had another <i>Bible</i> ready;
but slow and sure is my maxim.&nbsp; The book which I am at
present about will consist, if I live to finish it of a series of
Rembrandt pictures interspersed here and there with a
Claude.&nbsp; I shall tell the world of my parentage, my early
thoughts and habits; how I became a sap-engro, or viper-catcher;
my wanderings with the regiment in England, Scotland and Ireland
. . . Then a great deal about Norwich, Billy Taylor, Thurtell,
etc.; how I took to study and became a lav-engro.&nbsp; What do
you think of this as a bill of fare for the <i>first</i>
Vol.?&nbsp; The second will consist of my adventures in London as
an author in the year &rsquo;23 (<i>sic</i>), adventures on the
Big North Road in &rsquo;24 (<i>sic</i>), Constantinople,
etc.&nbsp; The third&mdash;but I shall tell you no more of my
secrets.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter to John Murray (25th Oct. 8843), the title is
referred to as <i>Lavengro</i>: <i>A Biography</i>.&nbsp; It is
to be &ldquo;full of grave fun and solemn laughter like the
<i>Bible</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On 6th December he again
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I do not wish for my next book to be
advertised yet; I have a particular reason.&nbsp; The Americans
are up to everything which affords a prospect of gain, and I
should not wonder that, provided I were to announce my title, and
the book did not appear forthwith, they would write one for me
and send forth their trash into the world under my name.&nbsp;
For my own part I am in no hurry,&rdquo; he proceeds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am writing to please myself, and am quite sure that if I
can contrive to please myself, I shall please the public
also.&nbsp; Had I written a book less popular than the
<i>Bible</i>, I should be less cautious; but I know how much is
expected from me, and also know what a roar of exultation would
be raised by my enemies (and I have plenty) were I to produce
anything that was not first rate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time after time he insists upon his determination to publish
nothing that is not &ldquo;as good as the last.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall go on with my <i>Life</i>,&rdquo; he writes, to
Ford (9th Feb. 1844), &ldquo;but slowly and lazily.&nbsp; What I
write, however, is <i>good</i>.&nbsp; I feel it is good, strange
and wild as it is.&rdquo; <a name="citation367"></a><a
href="#footnote367" class="citation">[367]</a></p>
<p>From 24th&ndash;27th Jan. 1844 that &ldquo;most astonishing
fellow&rdquo; Richard Ford visited Borrow at Oulton, urging again
in person, most likely, the lifting of the veil that obscured
those seven mysterious years.&nbsp; Ford has himself described
this visit to Borrow in a letter written from Oulton Hall.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am here on a visit to <i>El
Gitano</i>;&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;two &lsquo;rum&rsquo; coves,
in a queer country . . . we defy the elements, and chat over
<i>las cosas de Espa&ntilde;a</i>, and he tells me portions of
his life, more strange even than his book.&nbsp; We scamper by
day over the country in a sort of gig, which reminds me of Mr
Weare on his trip with Mr THURTELL [Borrow&rsquo;s old
preceptor]; &lsquo;Sidi Habismilk&rsquo; is in the stable and a
Zamarra [sheepskin coat] now before me, writing as I am in a sort
of summer-house called <i>La Mezquita</i>, in which <i>El
Gitano</i> concocts his lucubrations, and <i>paints</i> his
pictures, for his object is to colour up and poetise his
adventures.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this last sentence Ford showed how thoroughly he understood
Borrow&rsquo;s literary methods.&nbsp; A fortnight later Borrow
writes to Ford:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how I miss you and
our chats by the fireside.&nbsp; The wine, now I am alone, has
lost its flavour, and the cigars make me ill.&nbsp; I am
frequently in my valley of the shadows, and had I not my summer
jaunt [the Eastern Tour] to look forward to, I am afraid it would
be all up with your friend and <i>Batushka</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Eastern Tour considerably interfered with the writing of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; There was a seven months&rsquo; break; but
Borrow settled down to work on it again, still determined to take
his time and produce a book that should be better than <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s <i>Hand-Book for Travellers in Spain and Readers
at Home</i> appeared in 1845, a work that had cost its author
upwards of sixteen years of labour.&nbsp; In a letter to Borrow
he characterised it as &ldquo;a <i>rum</i> book and has queer
stuff in it, although much expurgated for the sake of
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford was very anxious that Borrow should keep
the promise that he had given two years previously to review the
<i>Hand-Book</i> when it appeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will do it
<i>magnificently</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou art the
man,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ford had written with the greatest
enthusiasm.&nbsp; On 2nd June an article of thirty-seven folio
pages was despatched by Borrow to John Murray for <i>The
Quarterly Review</i>, with the following from Mrs
Borrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With regard to the article, it must not be
received as a specimen of what Mr Borrow would have produced had
he been well, but he considered his promise to Mr Ford
sacred&mdash;and it is only to be wished that it had been written
under more favourable circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was ill
at the time, having been &ldquo;very unwell for the last
month,&rdquo; as Mrs Borrow explains, &ldquo;and particularly so
lately.&nbsp; Shivering fits have been succeeded by burning
fever, till his strength was much reduced; and he at present
remains in a low, and weak state, and what is worse, we are by no
means sure that the disease is subdued.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ford saw in Borrow &ldquo;a crack reviewer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo; . . . You have,&rdquo; he assured him in 1843,
&ldquo;only to write a <i>long letter</i>, having read the book
carefully and thought over the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford also
wrote to Borrow (26th Oct. 1843): &ldquo;I have written several
letters to Murray recommending them to <i>bag</i> you forthwith,
unless they are demented.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no doubt in his,
Ford&rsquo;s, mind as to the acceptance of Borrow&rsquo;s
article.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If insanity does not rule the <i>Q. R.</i>
camp, they will embrace the offer with open arms in their present
Erebus state of dullness,&rdquo; he tells Borrow, then, with a
burst of confidence continues, &ldquo;But, barring politics, I
confidentially tell you that the <i>Ed</i>[<i>inburgh</i>]
<i>Rev.</i> does business in a more liberal and more
business-like manner than the <i>Q</i>[<i>uarterly</i>]
<i>Rev.</i>&nbsp; I am always dunning this into Murray&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; More flies are caught with honey than vinegar.&nbsp;
Soft sawder, especially if plenty of <i>gold</i> goes into the
composition, cements a party and keeps earnest pens
together.&nbsp; I grieve, for my heart is entirely with the <i>Q.
R.</i>, its views and objects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article turned out to be, not a review of the
<i>Hand-Book</i>, but a bitter attack on Spain and her
rulers.&nbsp; The second part was to some extent germane to the
subject, but it appears to have been more concerned with
Borrow&rsquo;s view of Spain and things Spanish than with
Ford&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Lockhart saw that it would not do.&nbsp;
In a letter to John Murray he explains very clearly and very
justly the objections to using the article as it stood.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he writes (13th
June), &ldquo;after Borrow has so kindly exerted himself during
illness, that I must return his paper.&nbsp; I read the MS. with
much pleasure; but clever and brilliant as he is sure always to
be, it was very evident that he had not done such an article as
Ford&rsquo;s merits required; and I therefore intended to adopt
Mr Borrow&rsquo;s lively diatribe, but interweave with his matter
and add to it, such observations and extracts as might, I
thought, complete the paper in a <i>review sense</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it appears that Mr B. won&rsquo;t allow anybody to
tamper with his paper; therefore here it is.&nbsp; It will be
highly ornamental as it stands to any <i>Magazine</i>, and I have
no doubt either <i>Blackwood</i> or <i>Fraser</i> or
<i>Colburn</i> will be [only] too happy to insert it next month,
if applied to now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Borrow would not have liked that, when his <i>Bible
in Spain</i> came out, we should have printed a brilliant essay
by Ford on some point of Spanish interest, but including hardly
anything calculated to make the public feel that a new author of
high consequence had made his appearance among us&mdash;one
bearing the name, not of Richard Ford, but of George
Borrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lockhart was right and Borrow was wrong.&nbsp; There is no
room for equivocation.&nbsp; Borrow should have sunk his pride in
favour of his friendship for Ford, who had, even if occasionally
a little tedious in his epistolary enthusiasm, always been a
loyal friend; but Borrow was ill and excuses must be made for
him.&nbsp; Lockhart wrote also to Ford describing Borrow&rsquo;s
paper as &ldquo;just another capital chapter of his <i>Bible in
Spain</i>,&rdquo; which he had read with delight, but there was
&ldquo;hardly a word of <i>review</i>, and no extract giving the
least notion of the peculiar merits and style especially, of the
<i>Hand-Book</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is unwell,&rdquo;
continued Lockhart, &ldquo;I should be very sorry to bother him
more at present; and, moreover, from the little he has said of
your <i>style</i>, I am forced to infer that a <i>review</i> of
your book by him would never be what I could feel authorised to
publish in the <i>Q. R.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter concludes
with a word of condolence that the <i>Hand-Book</i> will have to
be committed to other hands.</p>
<p>Ford realised the difficulty of the situation in which he was
placed, and strove to wriggle out of it by telling Borrow that
his wife had said all along that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Borrow can&rsquo;t write anything
dull enough for your set; I wonder how I ever married one of
them,&rsquo;&mdash;I hope and trust you will not cancel the
paper, for we can&rsquo;t afford to lose a scrap of your queer
sparkle and &lsquo;thousand bright daughters
circumvolving.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have recommended its insertion in
<i>Blackwood</i>, <i>Fraser</i>, or some of those clever
Magazines, who will be overjoyed to get such a hand as yours, and
I will bet any man &pound;5 that your paper will be the most
popular of all they print.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that Ford was genuinely distressed, and in his
anxiety to be loyal to his friend rather overdid it.&nbsp; His
letter has an air of patronage that the writer certainly never
intended.&nbsp; The outstanding feature is its absolute
selflessness.&nbsp; Ford never seems to think of himself, or that
Borrow might have made a concession to their friendship.&nbsp;
Happy Ford!&nbsp; The unfortunate episode estranged Borrow from
Ford.&nbsp; Letters between them became less and less frequent
and finally ceased altogether, although Borrow did not forget to
send to his old friend a copy of <i>Lavengro</i> when it
appeared.</p>
<p>Worries seemed to rain down upon Borrow&rsquo;s head about
this time.&nbsp; Samuel Morton Peto (afterwards Sir Samuel) had
decided to enrich Lowestoft by improving the harbour and building
a railway to Reedham, about half-way between Yarmouth and
Norwich.&nbsp; He was authorised by Parliament and duly
constructed his line, which not even Borrow&rsquo;s anger could
prevent from passing through the Oulton Estate, between the Hall
and the Cottage.&nbsp; Borrow could not fight an Act of
Parliament, which forced him to cross a railway bridge on his way
to church; but he never forgave the man who had contrived it, or
his millions.&nbsp; His first thought had been to fly before the
invader.&nbsp; All quiet would be gone from the place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sell and be off,&rdquo; advised Ford; &ldquo;I hope you
will make the railway pay dear for its whistle,&rdquo; quietly
observed John Murray.&nbsp; At first Borrow was inclined to take
Ford&rsquo;s advice and settle abroad; but subsequently
relinquished the idea.</p>
<p>He was not, however, the man quietly to sit down before what
he conceived to be an unjustifiable outrage to his right to be
quiet.&nbsp; He never forgave railways, although forced sometimes
to make use of them.&nbsp; Samuel Morton Peto became to him the
embodiment of evil, and as &ldquo;Mr Flamson flaming in his coach
with a million&rdquo; he is immortalised in <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.</p>
<p>It is said that Sir Samuel boasted that he had made more than
the price he had paid for Borrow&rsquo;s land out of the gravel
he had taken from off it.&nbsp; On one occasion, after he had
bought Somerleyton Hall, happening to meet Borrow, he remarked
that he never called upon him, and Borrow remembering the boast
replied, &ldquo;I call on you!&nbsp; Do you think I don&rsquo;t
read my Shakespeare?&nbsp; Do you think I don&rsquo;t know all
about those highwaymen Bardolph and Peto?&rdquo; <a
name="citation372"></a><a href="#footnote372"
class="citation">[372]</a></p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Oulton appears to have been infested with
thieves, and poachers found admirable &ldquo;cover&rdquo; in the
surrounding plantations, or small woods.&nbsp; On several
occasions Borrow himself had been attacked at night on the
highway between Lowestoft and Oulton.&nbsp; Once he had even been
shot at and nearly overpowered.&nbsp; John Murray (the Second) on
hearing of one of these assaults had written (1841) artfully
enquiring, &ldquo;Were your wood thieves Gypsies, and have the
<i>Cal&eacute;s</i> got notice of your publication [<i>The
Zincali</i>]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had written to John Murray, Junr. (10th May
1842):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been dreadfully unwell since I last
heard from you&mdash;a regular nervous attack.&nbsp; At present I
have a bad cough, caught by getting up at night in pursuit of
poachers and thieves.&nbsp; A horrible neighbourhood
this&mdash;not a magistrate dares do his duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
18th September 1843 he again wrote to John Murray: &ldquo;One of
the Magistrates in this district is just dead.&nbsp; Present my
compliments to Mr Gladstone and tell him that the <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> would have no objection to become &lsquo;a great
unpaid!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gladstone is said greatly to have admired <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, even to the extent of writing to John Murray
counselling him to have amended a passage that he considered
ill-advised.&nbsp; Gladstone&rsquo;s letter was sent on to
Borrow, and he acknowledges its receipt (6th November 1843) in
the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many thanks for the perusal of Mr
Gladstone&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; I esteem it a high honour that so
distinguished a man should take sufficient interest in a work of
mine as to suggest any thing in emendation.&nbsp; I can have no
possible objection to modify the passage alluded to.&nbsp; It
contains some strong language, particularly the sentence about
the scarlet Lady, which it would be perhaps as well to
omit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offending passage was that in which Borrow says, when
describing the interior of the Mosque at Tangier: &ldquo;I looked
around for the abominable thing, and found it not; no scarlet
strumpet with a crown of false gold sat nursing an ugly
changeling in a niche.&rdquo;&nbsp; In later editions the words
&ldquo;no scarlet strumpet,&rdquo; etc., were changed to
&ldquo;the besetting sin of the pseudo-Christian Church did not
stare me in the face in every corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amendment was little likely to please a Churchman of
Gladstone&rsquo;s calibre, or procure for the writer the
magistracy he coveted, even if it had been made less
grudgingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must not make any further alterations
here,&rdquo; Borrow wrote to Murray a few days later,
&ldquo;otherwise the whole soliloquy, which is full of vigor and
poetry, and moreover of <i>truth</i>, would be entirely
spoiled.&nbsp; As it is, I cannot help feeling that [it] is
considerably damaged.&rdquo;&nbsp; There seems very little doubt
that this passage was referred to in the letter that John Murray
encloses in his of 10th July 1843 <a name="citation374"></a><a
href="#footnote374" class="citation">[374]</a> with this
reference: &ldquo;(The writer of the enclosed note is a worthy
canon of St Paul&rsquo;s, and has evidently seen only the 1st
edition).&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pray present my best respects to the Canon
of St Paul&rsquo;s and tell him from me that he is a
<i>burro</i>, which meaneth Jackass, and that I wish he would
mind his own business, which he might easily do by attending a
little more to the accommodation of the public in his ugly
Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow appears to have set his mind on becoming a
magistrate.&nbsp; He had written to Lockhart (November 1843)
enquiring how he had best proceed to obtain such an
appointment.&nbsp; Lockhart was not able to give him any very
definite information, his knowledge of such things, as he
confessed, &ldquo;being Scotch.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the time being
the matter was allowed to drop, to be revived in 1847 by a direct
application from Borrow to Lord Clarendon to support his
application with the Lord Chancellor.&nbsp; His claims were based
upon (1) his being a large landed-proprietor in the district (Mrs
Borrow had become the owner of the Oulton Hall Estate during the
previous year); (2) the fact that the neighbourhood was over-run
with thieves and undesirable characters; (3) that there was no
magistrate residing in the district.&nbsp; Lord Clarendon
promised his good offices, but suggested that as all such
appointments were made through the Lord-Lieutenant of the County,
the Earl of Stradbroke had better be acquainted with what was
taking place.&nbsp; This was done through the Hon. Wm. Rufus
Rous, Lord Stradbroke&rsquo;s brother, whose interest was
obtained by some of Borrow&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>After a delay of two months, Lord Stradbroke wrote to Lord
Clarendon that he was quite satisfied with &ldquo;the number and
efficiency of the Magistrates&rdquo; and also with the way in
which the Petty Sessions were attended.&nbsp; He could hear of no
complaint, and when the time came to increase the number of
J.P.&rsquo;s, he would be pleased to add Borrow&rsquo;s name to
the list, provided he were advised to do so by &ldquo;those
gentlemen residing in the neighbourhood, who, living on terms of
intimacy with them [the Magistrates], will be able to maintain
that union of good feeling which . . . exists in all our benches
of Petty Sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow would have made a good magistrate, provided the
offender were not a gypsy.&nbsp; He would have caused the
wrong-doer more fear the instrument of the law rather than the
law itself, and some of his sentences might possibly have been as
summary as those of Judge Lynch.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was a fine thing,&rdquo; writes a
contemporary, &ldquo;to see the great man tackle a tramp.&nbsp;
Then he scented the battle from afar, bearing down on the enemy
with a quivering nostril.&nbsp; If the nomad happened to be a
gypsy he was courteously addressed.&nbsp; But were he a mere
native tatterdemalion, inclined to be truculent, Borrow&rsquo;s
coat was off in a moment, and the challenge to decide there and
then who was the better man flung forth.&nbsp; I have never seen
such challenges accepted, for Borrow was robust and
towering.&rdquo; <a name="citation375"></a><a href="#footnote375"
class="citation">[375]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not strange that Borrow&rsquo;s application failed; for
he never refused leave to the gypsies to camp upon his land, and
would sometimes join them beside their campfires.&nbsp; Once he
took a guest with him after dinner to where the gypsies were
encamped.&nbsp; They received Borrow with every mark of
respect.&nbsp; Presently he &ldquo;began to intone to them a
song, written by him in Romany, which recounted all their tricks
and evil deeds.&nbsp; The gypsies soon became excited; then they
began to kick their property about, such as barrels and tin cans;
then the men began to fight and the women to part them; an uproar
of shouts and recriminations set in, and the quarrel became so
serious that it was thought prudent to quit the scene.&rdquo; <a
name="citation376a"></a><a href="#footnote376a"
class="citation">[376a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In nothing can the
character of a people be read with greater certainty and
exactness than in its songs,&rdquo; <a name="citation376b"></a><a
href="#footnote376b" class="citation">[376b]</a> Borrow had
written. <a name="citation376c"></a><a href="#footnote376c"
class="citation">[376c]</a></p>
<p>These disappointments tended to embitter Borrow, who saw in
them only a conspiracy against him.&nbsp; There is little doubt
that Lord Stradbroke&rsquo;s enquiries had revealed some curious
gossip concerning the Master of Oulton Hall, possibly the dispute
with his rector over the inability of their respective dogs to
live in harmony; perhaps even the would-be magistrate&rsquo;s
predilection for the society of gypsies, and his profound
admiration for &ldquo;the Fancy&rdquo; had reached the
Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>The unfortunate and somewhat mysterious dispute with Dr
Bowring was another anxiety that Borrow had to face.&nbsp; He had
once remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd, Bowring, that you and
I have never had a quarrel.&rdquo; <a name="citation376d"></a><a
href="#footnote376d" class="citation">[376d]</a>&nbsp; In the
summer of 1842 he and Bowring seem to have been on excellent
terms.&nbsp; Borrow wrote asking for the return of the papers and
manuscripts that had remained in Bowring&rsquo;s hands since
1829, when the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i> was projected, as
Borrow hoped to bring out during the ensuing year a volume
entitled <i>Songs of Denmark</i>.&nbsp; The cordiality of the
letter may best be judged by the fact that in it he announces his
intention of having a copy of the forthcoming <i>Bible in
Spain</i> sent &ldquo;to my oldest, I may say my <i>only</i>
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1847 Bowring wrote to Borrow enquiring as to the Russian
route through Kiakhta, and asking if he could put him in the way
of obtaining the information for the use of a Parliamentary
Committee then enquiring into England&rsquo;s commercial
relations with China.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s reply is apparently no
longer in existence; but it drew from Bowring another letter
raising a question as to whether &ldquo;&lsquo;two hundred
merchants are allowed to visit Pekin every three
years.&rsquo;&nbsp; Are you certain this is in practice
now?&nbsp; Have you ever been to Kiakhta?&rdquo;&nbsp; It would
appear from Bowring&rsquo;s &ldquo;if summoned, your expenses
must be paid by the public,&rdquo; that Borrow had suggested
giving evidence before the Committee, hence Bowring&rsquo;s
question as to whether Borrow could speak from personal knowledge
of Kiakhta.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s claim against Bowring is that after promising
to use all his influence to get him appointed Consul at Canton,
he obtained the post for himself, passing off as his own the
Manchu-Tartar New Testament that Borrow had edited in St
Petersburg.&nbsp; There is absolutely no other evidence than that
contained in Borrow&rsquo;s Appendix to <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; There is very little doubt that Bowring was a man
who had no hesitation in seizing everything that presented itself
and turning it, as far as possible, to his own uses.&nbsp; In
this he was doing what most successful men have done and will
continue to do.&nbsp; He had been kind to Borrow, and had helped
him as far as lay in his power.&nbsp; He no doubt obtained all
the information he could from Borrow, as he would have done from
anyone else; but he never withheld his help.&nbsp; It has been
suggested that he really did mention Borrow as a candidate for
the Consulship and later, when in financial straits and finding
that Borrow had no chance of obtaining it, accepted Lord
Palmerston&rsquo;s offer of the post for himself.&nbsp; It is,
however, idle to speculate what actually happened.&nbsp; What
resulted was that Bowring as the &ldquo;Old Radical&rdquo; took
premier place in the Appendix-inferno that closed <i>The Romany
Rye</i>. <a name="citation378a"></a><a href="#footnote378a"
class="citation">[378a]</a></p>
<p>Fate seemed to conspire to cause Borrow chagrin.&nbsp; Early
in 1847 it came to his knowledge that there were in existence
some valuable Codices in certain churches and convents in the
Levant.&nbsp; In particular there was said to be an original of
the Greek New Testament, supposed to date from the fourth
century, which had been presented to the convent on Mount Sinai
by the Emperor Justinian.&nbsp; Borrow received information of
the existence of the treasure, and also a hint that with a little
address, some of these priceless manuscripts might be secured to
the British Nation.&nbsp; It was even suggested that application
might be made to the Government by the Trustees of the British
Museum. <a name="citation378b"></a><a href="#footnote378b"
class="citation">[378b]</a>&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s reply to this
was an intimation that if requested to do so he would willingly
undertake the mission.&nbsp; Nothing, however, came of the
project, and the remainder of the manuscript of the Greek
Testament (part of it had been acquired in 1843 by Tischendorf)
was presented by the monks to Alexander II. and it is now in the
Imperial Library at St Petersburg.</p>
<p>The information as to the existence of the manuscripts, it is
alleged, was given to the Museum Trustees by the Hon. Robert
Curzon, who had travelled much in Egypt and the Holy Land.&nbsp;
It was certainly no fault of his that the mission was not sent
out, and Borrow&rsquo;s subsequent antagonism to him and his
family is difficult to understand and impossible to explain.</p>
<p>Borrow had achieved literary success: before the year 1847
<i>The Zincali</i> was in its Fourth Edition (nearly 10,000
copies having been printed) and <i>The Bible in Spain</i> had
reached its Eighth Edition (nearly 20,000 copies having been
printed).&nbsp; He was an unqualified success; yet he had been
far happier when distributing Testaments in Spain.&nbsp; The
greyness and inaction of domestic life, even when relieved by
occasional excursions with Sidi Habismilk and the Son of the
Miracle, were irksome to his temperament, ever eager for
occupation and change of scene.&nbsp; He was like a war-horse
champing his bit during times of peace.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why did you send me down six copies [of
<i>The Zincali</i>]?&rdquo; he bursts out in a letter to John
Murray (29th Jan. 1846).&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom should I send them
to?&nbsp; Do you think I have six friends in the world?&nbsp; Two
I have presented to my wife and daughter (in law).&nbsp; I shall
return three to you by the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1847, through the Harveys, he became acquainted with Dr
Thomas Gordon Hake, who was in practice at Brighton 1832&ndash;37
and at Bury St Edmunds 1839&ndash;53, and who was also a
poet.&nbsp; The two families visited each other, and Dr Hake has
left behind him some interesting stories about, and valuable
impressions of, Borrow.&nbsp; Dr Hake shows clearly that he did
not allow his friendship to influence his judgment when in his
<i>Memoirs</i> he described Borrow as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;one of those whose mental powers are
strong, and whose bodily frame is yet stronger&mdash;a
conjunction of forces often detrimental to a literary career, in
an age of intellectual predominance.&nbsp; His temper was good
and bad; his pride was humility; his humility was pride; his
vanity in being negative, was one of the most positive
kind.&nbsp; He was reticent and candid, measured in speech, with
an emphasis that made trifles significant.&rdquo; <a
name="citation379"></a><a href="#footnote379"
class="citation">[379]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rather laboured series of paradoxes quite fails to give a
convincing impression of the man.&nbsp; A much better idea of
Borrow is to be found in a letter (1847) by a fellow-guest at a
breakfast given by the Prussian Ambassador.&nbsp; He writes that
there was present</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the amusing author of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, a man who is remarkable for his extraordinary powers
as a linguist, and for the originality of his character, not to
speak of the wonderful adventures he narrates, and the ease and
facility with which he tells them.&nbsp; He kept us laughing a
good part of breakfast time by the oddity of his remarks, as well
as the positiveness of his assertions, often rather startling,
and like his books partaking of the marvellous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation380a"></a><a href="#footnote380a"
class="citation">[380a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abandoning paradox, Dr Hake is more successful in his
description of Borrow&rsquo;s person.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His figure was tall,&rdquo; he tells us,
&ldquo;and his bearing very noble; he had a finely moulded head,
and thick white hair&mdash;white from his youth; his brown eyes
were soft, yet piercing; his nose somewhat of the
&lsquo;semitic&rsquo; type, which gave his face the cast of the
young Memnon.&nbsp; His mouth had a generous curve; and his
features, for beauty and true power, were such as can have no
parallel in our portrait gallery.&rdquo; <a
name="citation380b"></a><a href="#footnote380b"
class="citation">[380b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When not occupied in writing, Borrow would walk about the
estate with his animals, between whom and their master a perfect
understanding existed.&nbsp; Sidi Habismilk would come to a
whistle and would follow him about, and his two dogs and cat
would do the same.&nbsp; When he went for a walk the dogs and cat
would set out with him; but the cat would turn back after
accompanying him for about a quarter of a mile. <a
name="citation381a"></a><a href="#footnote381a"
class="citation">[381a]</a></p>
<p>The two young undergraduates who drove in a gig from Cambridge
to Oulton to pay their respects to Borrow (<i>circa</i> 1846)
described him as employed</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;in training some young horses to follow him
about like dogs and come at the call of his whistle.&nbsp; As my
two friends <a name="citation381b"></a><a href="#footnote381b"
class="citation">[381b]</a> were talking with him, Borrow sounded
his whistle in a paddock near the house, which, if I remember
rightly, was surrounded by a low wall.&nbsp; Immediately two
beautiful horses came bounding over the fence and trotted up to
their master.&nbsp; One put his nose into Borrow&rsquo;s
outstretched hand and the other kept snuffing at his pockets in
expectation of the usual bribe for confidence and good
behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s love of animals was almost feminine.&nbsp; The
screams of a hare pursued by greyhounds would spoil his appetite
for dinner, and he confessed himself as &ldquo;silly enough to
feel disgust and horror at the squeals of a rat in the fangs of a
terrier.&rdquo; <a name="citation381c"></a><a
href="#footnote381c" class="citation">[381c]</a>&nbsp; When a
favourite cat was so ill that it crawled away to die in solitude,
Borrow went in search of it and, discovering the poor creature in
the garden-hedge, carried it back into the house, laid it in a
comfortable place and watched over it until it died.&nbsp; His
care of the much persecuted &ldquo;Church of England cat&rdquo;
at Llangollen <a name="citation381d"></a><a href="#footnote381d"
class="citation">[381d]</a> is another instance of his
tender-heartedness with regard to animals.</p>
<p>Borrow had ample evidence that he was still a celebrity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was much courted . . . by his neighbours and by
visitors to the sea-side,&rdquo; Dr Hake relates; but
unfortunately he allowed himself to become a prey to moods at
rather inappropriate moments.&nbsp; As a lion, Borrow accompanied
Dr Hake to some in the great houses of the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
On one occasion they went to dine at Hardwick Hall, the residence
of Sir Thomas and Lady Cullum.&nbsp; The last-named subsequently
became a firm friend of Borrow&rsquo;s during many years.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The party consisted of Lord Bristol; Lady
Augusta Seymour, his daughter; Lord and Lady Arthur Hervey; Sir
Fitzroy Kelly; Mr Thackeray, and ourselves.&nbsp; At that date,
Thackeray had made money by lectures on <i>The Satirists</i>, and
was in good swing; but he never could realise the independent
feelings of those who happen to be born to fortune&mdash;a thing
which a man of genius should be able to do with ease.&nbsp; He
told Lady Cullum, which she repeated to me, that no one could
conceive how it mortified him to be making a provision for his
daughters by delivering lectures; and I thought she rather
sympathised with him in this degradation.&nbsp; He approached
Borrow, who, however, received him very dryly.&nbsp; As a last
attempt to get up a conversation with him, he said, &lsquo;Have
you read my Snob Papers in <i>Punch</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In <i>Punch</i>?&rsquo; asked Borrow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a periodical I never look at!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very fine dinner.&nbsp; The plates at dessert
were of gold; they once belonged to the Emperor of the French,
and were marked with his &ldquo;N&rdquo; and his Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thackeray, as if under the impression that the party
was invited to look at him, thought it necessary to make a
figure, and absorb attention during the dessert, by telling
stories and more than half acting them; the aristocratic party
listening, but appearing little amused.&nbsp; Borrow knew better
how to behave in good company, and kept quiet; though, doubtless
he felt his mane.&rdquo; <a name="citation382"></a><a
href="#footnote382" class="citation">[382]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were other moments when Borrow caused acute
embarrassment by his rudeness.&nbsp; Once his hostess, a simple
unpretending woman desirous only of pleasing her distinguished
guest, said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr Borrow, I have read your books with so
much pleasure!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, what books do you mean,
madam?&nbsp; Do you mean my account books?&rdquo; was the
ungracious retort.&nbsp; He then rose from the table, fretting
and fuming and walked up and down the dining-room among the
servants &ldquo;during the whole of the dinner, and afterwards
wandered about the rooms and passage, till the carriage could be
ordered for our return home.&rdquo; <a name="citation383a"></a><a
href="#footnote383a" class="citation">[383a]</a>&nbsp; The reason
for this unpardonable behaviour appears to have been ill-judged
loyalty to a friend.&nbsp; His host was a well-known Suffolk
banker who, having advanced a large sum of money to a friend of
Borrow&rsquo;s, the heir to a considerable estate, who was in
temporary difficulties, then &ldquo;struck the docket&rdquo; in
order to secure payment.&nbsp; Borrow confided to another friend
that he yearned &ldquo;to cane the banker.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
loyalty to his friend excuses his wrath; it was his judgment that
was at fault.&nbsp; He should undoubtedly have caned the banker,
in preference to going to his house as a guest and revenging his
friend upon the gentle and amiable woman who could not be held
responsible for her husband&rsquo;s business transgressions.</p>
<p>Unfortunate remarks seemed to have a habit of bursting from
Borrow&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; When Dr Bowring introduced to him his
son, Mr F. J. Bowring, and with pardonable pride added that he
had just become a Fellow of Trinity, Borrow remarked,
&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Fellows of Trinity always marry their
bed-makers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Agnes Strickland was another
victim.&nbsp; Being desirous of meeting him and, in spite of
Borrow&rsquo;s unwillingness, achieving her object, she expressed
in rapturous terms her admiration of his works, and concluded by
asking permission to send him a copy of <i>The Queens of
England</i>, to which he ungraciously replied, &ldquo;For
God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t, madam; I should not know where to
put them or what to do with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
damned fool that woman is!&rdquo; he remarked to W. B. Donne, who
was standing by. <a name="citation383b"></a><a
href="#footnote383b" class="citation">[383b]</a></p>
<p>There is a world of meaning in a paragraph from one of John
Murray&rsquo;s (the Second) letters (21st June 1843) to Borrow in
which he enquires, &ldquo;Did you receive a note from Mme.
Simpkinson which I forwarded ten days ago?&nbsp; I have not seen
her since your abrupt departure from her house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is rather regrettable that the one side of Borrow&rsquo;s
character has to be so emphasised.&nbsp; He could be just and
gracious, even to the point of sternly rebuking one who
represented his own religious convictions and supporting a
dissenter.&nbsp; After a Bible Society&rsquo;s meeting at Mutford
Bridge (the nearest village to Oulton Hall), the speakers
repaired to the Hall to supper.&nbsp; One of the guests, an
independent minister, became involved in a heated argument with a
Church of England clergyman, who reproached him for holding
Calvinistic views.&nbsp; The nonconformist replied that the
clergy of the Established Church were equally liable to attack on
the same ground, because the Articles of their Church were
Calvinistic, and to these they had all sworn assent.&nbsp; The
reply was that the words were not necessarily to be taken in
their literal sense.&nbsp; At this Borrow interposed, attacking
the clergyman in a most vigorous fashion for his sophistry, and
finally reducing him to silence.&nbsp; The Independent minister
afterwards confessed that he had never heard &ldquo;one man give
another such a dressing down as on that occasion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation384a"></a><a href="#footnote384a"
class="citation">[384a]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was capable of very deep feeling, which is nowhere
better shown than in his retort to Richard Latham whom he met at
Dr Hake&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; Well warmed by the generous wine,
Latham stated that he should never do anything so low as dine
with his publisher.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not dine with John
Murray, I presume?&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed I
do,&rdquo; Borrow responded with deep emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
a most kind friend.&nbsp; When I have had sickness in the house
he has been unfailing in his goodness towards me.&nbsp; There is
no man I more value.&rdquo; <a name="citation384b"></a><a
href="#footnote384b" class="citation">[384b]</a></p>
<p>Borrow was a frequent visitor to the Hakes at Bury St
Edmunds.&nbsp; W. B. Donne gives a glimpse to him in a letter to
Bernard Barton (12th Sept. 1848).</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have had a great man here&mdash;and I
have been walking with him and aiding him to eat salmon and
mutton and drink port&mdash;George Borrow&mdash;and what is more
we fell in with some gypsies and I heard his speech of Egypt,
which sounded wondrously like a medley of broken Spanish and dog
Latin.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s face lighted by the red turf fire of
the tent was worth looking at.&nbsp; He is ashy-white
now&mdash;but twenty years ago, when his hair was like a
raven&rsquo;s wing, he must have been hard to discriminate from a
born Bohemian.&nbsp; Borrow is best on the tramp: if you can walk
4.5 miles per hour, as I can with ease and do by choice, and can
walk 15 of them at a stretch&mdash;which I can compass
also&mdash;then he will talk Iliads of adventures even better
than his printed ones.&nbsp; He cannot abide those Amateur
Pedestrians who saunter, and in his chair he is given to groan
and be contradictory.&nbsp; But on Newmarket-heath, in Rougham
Woods he is at home, and specially when he meets with a thorough
vagabond like your present correspondent.&rdquo; <a
name="citation385a"></a><a href="#footnote385a"
class="citation">[385a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present Mr John Murray recollects Borrow very clearly
as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;tall, broad, muscular, with very heavy
shoulders&rdquo; and of course the white hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was,&rdquo; continues Mr Murray, &ldquo;a figure which no one who
has seen it is likely to forget.&nbsp; I never remember to have
seen him dressed in anything but black broad cloth, and white
cotton socks were generally distinctly visible above his low
shoes.&nbsp; I think that with Borrow the desire to attract
attention to himself, to inspire a feeling of awe and mystery,
must have been a ruling passion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was frequently the guest of his publisher at Albemarle
Street, in times well within the memory of Mr Murray, who relates
how on one occasion</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Borrow was at a dinner-party in company
with Whewell <a name="citation385b"></a><a href="#footnote385b"
class="citation">[385b]</a> [who by the way it has been said was
the original of the Flaming Tinman, although there is very little
to support the statement except the fact that Dr Whewell was a
proper man with his hands] both of them powerful men, and both of
them, if report be true, having more than a superficial knowledge
of the art of self-defence.&nbsp; A controversy began, and waxed
so warm that Mrs Whewell, believing a personal encounter to be
imminent, fainted, and had to be carried out of the room.&nbsp;
Once when Borrow was dining with my father he disappeared into a
small back room after dinner, and could not be found.&nbsp; At
last he was discovered by a lady member of the family, stretched
on a sofa and groaning.&nbsp; On being spoken to and asked to
join the other guests, he suddenly said: Go away! go away!&nbsp;
I am not fit company for respectable people.&nbsp; There was no
apparent cause for this strange conduct, unless it were due to
one of those unaccountable fits to which men of genius (and this
description will be allowed him by many) are often subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On another occasion, when dining with my father at
Wimbledon, he was regaled with a &lsquo;haggis,&rsquo; a dish
which was new to him, and of which he partook to an extent which
would have astonished many a hardy Scotsman.&nbsp; One summers
day, several years later, he again came to dinner, and having
come on foot, entered the house by a garden door, his first
words&mdash;without any previous greetings&mdash;were: &lsquo;Is
there a haggis to-day?&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation386"></a><a
href="#footnote386" class="citation">[386]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
LAVENGRO&mdash;1843&ndash;1851</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> all these years
<i>Lavengro</i> had been making progress towards completion,
irregular and spasmodic it would appear; but still each year
brought it nearer to the printer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot get out
of my old habits,&rdquo; Borrow wrote to Dawson Turner (15th
January 1844), &ldquo;I find I am writing the work . . . in
precisely the same manner as <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, viz., on
blank sheets of old account books, backs of letters, etc.&nbsp;
In slovenliness of manuscript I almost rival Mahomet, who, it is
said, wrote his <i>Coran</i> on mutton spade bones.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;His [Borrow&rsquo;s] biography will be passing strange if
he tells the <i>whole</i> truth,&rdquo; Ford writes to a friend
(27th February 1843).&nbsp; &ldquo;He is now writing it by my
advice.&nbsp; I go on . . . scribbling away, though with a
palpitating heart,&rdquo; Borrow informs John Murray (5th
February 1844), &ldquo;and have already plenty of scenes and
dialogues connected with my life, quite equal to anything in
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; The great difficulty, however,
is to blend them all into a symmetrical whole.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
17th September 1846 he writes again to his publisher:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have of late been very lazy, and am
become more addicted to sleep than usual, am seriously afraid of
apoplexy.&nbsp; To rouse myself, I rode a little time ago to
Newmarket.&nbsp; I felt all the better for it for a few
days.&nbsp; I have at present a first rate trotting horse who
affords me plenty of exercise.&nbsp; On my return from Newmarket,
I rode him nineteen miles before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another cause of delay was the &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; that were
constantly descending upon him.&nbsp; His determination to give
only the best of which he was capable, is almost tragic in the
light of later events.&nbsp; To his wife, he wrote from London
(February 1847): &ldquo;Saw M[urray] who is in a hurry for me to
begin [the printing].&nbsp; I will not be hurried though for
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, July 1848, under the heading
of Mr Murray&rsquo;s List of New Works in Preparation, there
appeared the first announcement of <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>an
Autobiography</i>, by George Borrow, Author of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, etc., 4 vols. post 8vo.&nbsp; This was repeated in
October.&nbsp; During the next two months the book was advertised
as <i>Life</i>; <i>A Drama</i>, in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> and
<i>The Quarterly Review</i>, and the first title-page (1849) was
so printed.&nbsp; On 7th October John Murray wrote asking Borrow
to send the manuscript to the printer.&nbsp; This was accordingly
done, and about two-thirds of it composed.&nbsp; Then Borrow
appears to have fallen ill.&nbsp; On 5th January 1849 John Murray
wrote to Mrs Borrow:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I trust Mr Borrow is now restored to health
and tranquillity of mind, and that he will soon be able to resume
his pen.&nbsp; I desire this on his own account and for the sake
of poor Woodfall [the printer], who is of course inconvenienced
by having his press arrested after the commencement of the
printing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing on 27th November 1849, John Murray refers to the work
having been &ldquo;first sent to press&mdash;now nearly eighteen
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is clearly a mistake, as on 7th October
1848, thirteen and a half months previously, he asks Borrow to
send the manuscript to the printer that he may begin the
composition.&nbsp; John Murray was getting anxious and urges
Borrow to complete the work, which a year ago had been offered to
the booksellers at the annual trade-dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you are fastidious, and that you desire to
produce a work of distinguished excellence.&nbsp; I see the
result of this labour in the sheets as they come from the press,
and I think when it does appear it will make a sensation,&rdquo;
wrote the tactful publisher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think not, my dear
friend,&rdquo; replied Borrow, &ldquo;that I am idle.&nbsp; I am
finishing up the concluding part.&nbsp; I should be sorry to
hurry the work towards the last.&nbsp; I dare say it will be
ready by the middle of February.&rdquo;&nbsp; The correspondence
grew more and more tense.&nbsp; Mrs Borrow wrote to the printer
urging him to send to her husband, who has been overworked to the
point of complaint, &ldquo;one of your kind encouraging
notes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later Borrow went to Yarmouth, where
sea-bathing produced a good effect upon his health; but still the
manuscript was not sent to the despairing printer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not, God knows! wish you to overtask yourself,&rdquo; wrote
the unhappy Woodfall; &ldquo;but after what you last said, I
thought I might fully calculate on your taking up, without
further delay, the fragmentary portions of your 1st and 2nd
volumes and let us get them out of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letters continued to pass to and fro, but the balance of
manuscript was not forthcoming until November 1850, when Mrs
Borrow herself took it to London.&nbsp; Another trade-dinner was
at hand, and John Murray had written to Mrs Borrow, &ldquo;If I
cannot show the book then&mdash;I must throw it up.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To Mrs Borrow this meant tragedy.&nbsp; The poor woman was
distracted, and from time to time she begs for encouraging
letters.&nbsp; In response to one of these appeals, John Murray
wrote with rare insight into Borrow&rsquo;s character, and
knowledge of what is most likely to please him: &ldquo;There are
passages in your book equal to De Foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preface when eventually submitted to John Murray disturbed
him somewhat.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quaint,&rdquo; he writes to Mrs
Borrow, &ldquo;but so is everything that Mr Borrow
writes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on to suggest that the latter
portion looks too much as if it had been got up in the interests
of &ldquo;Papal aggression,&rdquo; and he calls attention to the
oft-repeated &ldquo;Damnation cry&rdquo;.&nbsp; There appears to
have been some modification, a few &ldquo;Damnation Cries&rdquo;
omitted, the last sheet passed for press, and on 7th February
1851 <i>Lavengro</i> was published in an edition of three
thousand copies, which lasted for twenty-one years.</p>
<p>The appearance of <i>Lavengro</i> was indeed sensational: but
not quite in the way its publisher had anticipated.&nbsp; Almost
without exception the verdict was unfavourable.&nbsp; The book
was attacked vigorously.&nbsp; The keynote of the critics was
disappointment.&nbsp; Some reviews were purely critical, others
personal and abusive, but nearly all were disapproving.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Great is our disappointment&rdquo; said the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are disappointed,&rdquo;
echoed <i>Blackwood</i>.&nbsp; Among the few friendly notices was
that of Dr Hake, in which he prophesied that
&ldquo;<i>Lavengro&rsquo;s</i> roots will strike deep into the
soil of English letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Ford wrote (8th
March):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I frankly own that I am somewhat
disappointed with the very <i>little</i> you have told us about
<i>yourself</i>.&nbsp; I was in hopes to have a full, true, and
particular account of your marvellously varied and interesting
biography.&nbsp; I do hope that some day you will give it to
us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this chorus of dispraise Borrow saw a conspiracy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If ever a book experienced infamous and undeserved
treatment,&rdquo; he wrote, <a name="citation390"></a><a
href="#footnote390" class="citation">[390]</a> &ldquo;it was that
book.&nbsp; I was attacked in every form that envy and malice
could suggest.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>The Romany Rye</i> he has done
full justice to the subject, exhibiting the critics with blood
and foam streaming from their jaws.&nbsp; In the original draft
of the Advertisement to the same work he expresses himself as
&ldquo;proud of a book which has had the honour of being
rancorously abused and execrated by every unmanly scoundrel,
every sycophantic lacquey, and <i>every political and religious
renegade</i> in Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few years previously,
Borrow had written to John Murray, &ldquo;I have always
myself.&nbsp; If you wish to please the public leave the matter
[the revision of <i>The Zincali</i>] to me.&rdquo; <a
name="citation391a"></a><a href="#footnote391a"
class="citation">[391a]</a>&nbsp; From this it is evident that
Borrow was unprepared for anything but commendation from critics
and readers.</p>
<p>Dr Bowring had some time previously requested the editor of
<i>The Edinburgh Review</i> to allow him to review
<i>Lavengro</i>; but no notice ever appeared.&nbsp; In all
probability he realised the impossibility of writing about a book
in which he and his family appeared in such an unpleasant
light.&nbsp; It is unlikely that he asked for the book in order
to prevent a review appearing in <i>The Edinburgh</i>, as has
been suggested.</p>
<p>In the Preface, <i>Lavengro</i> is described as a dream; yet
there can be not a vestage of doubt that Borrow&rsquo;s original
intention had been to acknowledge it as an autobiography.&nbsp;
This work is a kind of biography in the Robinson Crusoe style, he
had written in 1844.&nbsp; This he contradicted in the Appendix
to <i>The Romany Rye</i>; yet in his manuscript autobiography <a
name="citation391b"></a><a href="#footnote391b"
class="citation">[391b]</a> (13th Oct. 1862) he says: &ldquo;In
1851 he published <i>Lavengro</i>, a work in which he gives an
account of his early life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why had Borrow changed
his mind?</p>
<p>When <i>Lavengro</i> was begun, as a result of Ford&rsquo;s
persistent appeals, Borrow was on the crest of the wave of
success.&nbsp; He saw himself the literary hero of the
hour.&nbsp; <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was selling in its
thousands.&nbsp; The press had proclaimed it a masterpiece.&nbsp;
He had seen himself a great man.&nbsp; The writer of a great
book, however, does not occupy a position so kinglike in its
loneliness as does gentleman a gypsy, round whom flock the
<i>gitanos</i> to kiss his hand and garments as if he were a god
or a hero.&nbsp; The literary and social worlds that <i>The Bible
in Spain</i> opened to Borrow were not to be awed by his mystery,
or, disciplined into abject hero-worship by one of those steady
penetrating gazes, which cowed jockeys and
<i>alguacils</i>.&nbsp; They claimed intellectual kinship and
equality, the very things that Borrow had no intention of
conceding them.&nbsp; He would have tolerated their
&ldquo;gentility nonsense&rdquo; if they would have acknowledged
his paramountcy.&nbsp; He found that to be a social or a literary
lion was to be a tame lion, and he was too big for that.&nbsp;
His conception of genius was that it had its moods, and
mediocrity must suffer them.</p>
<p>Borrow would rush precipitately from the house where he was a
guest; he would be unpardonably rude to some inoffensive and
well-meaning woman who thought to please him by admiring his
books; he would magnify a fight between their respective dogs
into a deadly feud between himself and the rector of his parish:
thus he made enemies by the dozen and, incidentally, earned for
himself an extremely unenviable reputation.&nbsp; A hero with a
lovable nature is twice a hero, because he is possessed of those
qualities that commend themselves to the greater number.&nbsp;
Wellington could never be a serious rival in a nation&rsquo;s
heart to dear, weak, sensitive, noble Nelson, who lived for
praise and frankly owned to it.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s lovable qualities were never permitted to show
themselves in public, they were kept for the dingle, the
fireside, or the inn-parlour.&nbsp; That he had a sweeter side to
his nature there can be no doubt, and those who saw it were his
wife, his step-daughter, and his friends, in particular those
who, like Mr Watts-Dunton and Mr A. Egmont Hake, have striven for
years to emphasise the more attractive part of his strange
nature.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s attitude towards literature in itself was not
calculated to gain friends for him.&nbsp; He was uncompromisingly
and caustically severe upon some of the literary idols of his
day, men who have survived that terrible handicap, contemporary
recognition and appreciation.</p>
<p>He was not a deep reader, hardly a reader at all in the
accepted meaning of the word.&nbsp; He frankly confessed that
books were to him of secondary importance to man as a subject for
study.&nbsp; In his criticisms of literature, he was apt to
confuse the man with his works.&nbsp; His hatred of Scott is
notorious; it was not the artist he so cordially disliked, but
the politician; he admitted that Scott &ldquo;wrote splendid
novels about the Stuarts.&rdquo; <a name="citation393a"></a><a
href="#footnote393a" class="citation">[393a]</a>&nbsp; He hailed
him as &ldquo;greater than Homer;&rdquo; <a
name="citation393b"></a><a href="#footnote393b"
class="citation">[393b]</a> but the House of Stuart he held in
utter detestation, and when writing or speaking of Scott he
forgot to make a rather necessary distinction.&nbsp; He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He admires his talents both as a prose
writer and a poet; as a poet especially. <a
name="citation393c"></a><a href="#footnote393c"
class="citation">[393c]</a> . . .&nbsp; As a prose writer he
admires him less, it is true, but his admiration for him in that
capacity is very high, and he only laments that he prostituted
his talents to the cause of the Stuarts and gentility . . . in
conclusion, he will say, in order to show the opinion which he
entertains of the power of Scott as a writer, that he did for the
spectre of the wretched Pretender what all the kings of Europe
could not do for his body&mdash;placed it on the throne of these
realms.&rdquo; <a name="citation393d"></a><a href="#footnote393d"
class="citation">[393d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In later years Borrow paid a graceful tribute to Scott&rsquo;s
memory.&nbsp; When at Kelso, in spite of the rain and mist, he
&ldquo;trudged away to Dryburgh to pay my respects to the tomb of
Walter Scott, a man with whose principles I have no sympathy, but
for whose genius I have always entertained the most intense
admiration.&rdquo; <a name="citation393e"></a><a
href="#footnote393e" class="citation">[393e]</a>&nbsp; It was
just the same with Byron, &ldquo;for whose writings I really
entertained considerable admiration, though I had no particular
esteem for the man himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation393f"></a><a
href="#footnote393f" class="citation">[393f]</a></p>
<p>With Wordsworth it was different, and it was his cordial
dislike of his poetry that prompted Borrow to introduce into
<i>The Romany Rye</i> that ineffectual episode of the man who was
sent to sleep by reading him.&nbsp; Tennyson he dismissed as a
writer of &ldquo;duncie books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Dickens he had an enthusiastic admiration as &ldquo;a
second Fielding, a young writer who . . . has evinced such
talent, such humour, variety and profound knowledge of character,
that he charms his readers, at least those who have the capacity
to comprehend him.&rdquo; <a name="citation394a"></a><a
href="#footnote394a" class="citation">[394a]</a>&nbsp; He was
delighted with <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> and <i>Oliver
Twist</i>.</p>
<p>His reading was anything but thorough, in fact he occasionally
showed a remarkable ignorance of contemporary writers.&nbsp; Mr
A. Egmont Hake tells how:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His conversation would sometimes turn on
modern literature, with which his acquaintance was very
slight.&nbsp; He seemed to avoid reading the products of modern
thought lest his own strong opinions should undergo
dilution.&nbsp; We were once talking of Keats whose fame had been
constantly increasing, but of whose poetry Borrow&rsquo;s
knowledge was of a shadowy kind, when suddenly he put a stop to
the conversation by ludicrously asking, in his strong voice,
&lsquo;Have they not been trying to resuscitate
him?&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation394b"></a><a
href="#footnote394b" class="citation">[394b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time that <i>Lavengro</i> appeared, Borrow was
estranged from his generation.&nbsp; The years that intervened
between the success of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> and the
publication of <i>Lavengro</i> had been spent by him in war; he
had come to hate his contemporaries with a wholesome, vigorous
hatred.&nbsp; He would give them his book; but they should have
it as a stray cur has a bone&mdash;thrown at them.&nbsp; Above
all, they should not for a moment be allowed to think that it
contained an intimate account of the life of the supreme hater
who had written it.&nbsp; When there had been sympathy between
them, Borrow was prepared to allow his public to peer into the
sacred recesses of his early life.&nbsp; Now that there was none,
he denied that <i>Lavengro</i> was more than &ldquo;a
dream&rdquo;, forgetting that he had so often written of it as an
autobiography, had even seen it advertised as such, and insisted
that it was fiction.</p>
<p>When <i>Lavengro</i> was published Borrow was an unhappy and
disappointed man.&nbsp; He had found what many other travellers
have found when they come home, that in the wilds he had left his
taste and toleration for conventional life and ideas.&nbsp; The
life in the Peninsula had been thoroughly congenial to a man of
Borrow&rsquo;s temperament: hardships, dangers,
imprisonments,&mdash;they were his common food.&nbsp; He who had
defied the whole power of Spain, found himself powerless to
prevent his Rector from keeping a dog, or a railway line from
being cut through his own estate and his peace of mind disturbed
by the rumble of trains and the shriek of
locomotive-whistles.&nbsp; He had beaten the Flaming Tinman and
Count Ofalia, but Samuel Morton Peto had vanquished and put him
to flight by virtue of an Act of Parliament, in all probability
without being conscious of having achieved a signal
victory.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s life had been built up upon a wrong
hypothesis: he strove to adapt, not himself to the Universe; but
the Universe to himself.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that a man with this attitude of mind would
regard as sheer vindictiveness the adverse criticism of a book
that he had written with such care, and so earnest an endeavour
to maintain if not improve upon the standard created in a former
work.&nbsp; It never for a moment struck him that the men who had
once hailed him &ldquo;great&rdquo;, should now admonish him as a
result of the honest exercise of their critical faculties.&nbsp;
No; there was conspiracy against him, and he tortured himself
into a pitiable state of wrath and melancholy.&nbsp; A later
generation has been less harsh in its judgment.&nbsp; The
controversial parts of <i>Lavengro</i> have become less
controversial and the magnificent parts have become more
magnificent, and it has taken its place as a star of the second
magnitude.</p>
<p>The question of what is actual autobiography and what is so
coloured as to become practically fiction, must always be a
matter of opinion.&nbsp; The early portion seems convincing, even
the first meeting with the gypsies in the lane at Norman
Cross.&nbsp; It has been asked by an eminent gypsy scholar how
Borrow knew the meaning of the word &ldquo;sap&rdquo;, or why he
addressed the gypsy woman as &ldquo;my mother&rdquo;.&nbsp; When
the Gypsy refers to the &ldquo;Sap there&rdquo;, the child
replies, &ldquo;what, the snake&rdquo;?&nbsp; The employment of
the other phrase is obviously an inadvertent use of knowledge he
gained later.</p>
<p>In writing to Mrs George Borrow (24th March 1851) to tell her
that W. B. Donne had been unable to obtain <i>Lavengro</i> for
<i>The Edinburgh Review</i> as it had been bespoken a year
previously by Dr Bowring, Dr Hake adds that Donne had written
&ldquo;putting the editor in possession of his view of
<i>Lavengro</i>, as regards verisimilitude, vouching for the
Daguerreotype-like fidelity of the picture in the first volume,
etc., etc., in order to prevent him from being <i>taken in by</i>
a spiteful article.&rdquo;&nbsp; This passage is very significant
as being written by one of Borrow&rsquo;s most intimate friends,
with the sure knowledge that its contents would reach him.&nbsp;
It leaves no room for doubt that, although Borrow denied publicly
the autobiographical nature of <i>Lavengro</i>, in his own circle
it was freely admitted and referred to as a life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is an autobiography?&rdquo; Borrow once asked Mr
Theodore Watts-Dunton (who had called his attention to several
bold coincidences in <i>Lavengro</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it the
mere record of the incidents of a man&rsquo;s life? or is it a
picture of the man himself&mdash;his character, his soul?&rdquo;
<a name="citation396"></a><a href="#footnote396"
class="citation">[396]</a>&nbsp; Mr Watts-Dunton confirms
Borrow&rsquo;s letters when he says &ldquo;That he [Borrow] sat
down to write his own life in <i>Lavengro</i> I know.&nbsp; He
had no idea then of departing from the strict line of
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At times Borrow seemed to find his pictures flat, and
heightened the colour in places, as a painter might heighten the
tone of a drapery, a roof or some other object, not because the
individual spot required it, but rather because the general
effect he was aiming at rendered it necessary.&nbsp; He did this
just as an actor rouges his face, darkens his eyebrows and round
his eyes, that he may appear to his audience a living man and not
an animated corpse.</p>
<p>Borrow was drawing himself, striving to be as faithful to the
original as Boswell to Johnson.&nbsp; Incidents! what were they?
the straw with which the bricks of personality are made.&nbsp; A
comparison of <i>Lavengro</i> with Borrow&rsquo;s letters to the
Bible Society is instructive; it is the same Borrow that appears
in both, with the sole difference that in the Letters he is less
mysterious, less in the limelight than in <i>Lavengro</i>.</p>
<p>Mr Watts-Dunton, with inspiration, has asked whether or not
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> form a spiritual
autobiography; and if they do, whether that autobiography does or
does not surpass every other for absolute truth of spiritual
representation.&nbsp; Borrow certainly did colour his narrative
in places.&nbsp; Who could write the story of his early life with
absolute accuracy? without dwelling on and elaborating certain
episodes, perhaps even adjusting them somewhat?&nbsp; That would
not necessarily prove them untrue.</p>
<p>There are, unquestionably, inconsistencies in <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>The Romany Rye</i>&mdash;they are admitted, they have been
pointed out.&nbsp; There are many inaccuracies, it must be
confessed; but because a man makes a mistake in the date of his
birth or even the year, it does not prove that he was not born at
all.&nbsp; Borrow was for ever making the most inaccurate
statements about his age.</p>
<p>In the main <i>Lavengro</i> would appear to be
autobiographical up to the period of Borrow&rsquo;s coming to
London.&nbsp; After this he begins to indulge somewhat in the
dramatic.&nbsp; The meeting with the pickpocket as a
thimble-rigger at Greenwich might pass muster were it not for the
<i>rencontre</i> with the apple-woman&rsquo;s son near
Salisbury.&nbsp; The Dingle episode may be accepted, for Mr John
Sampson has verified even the famous thunder-storm by means of
the local press.&nbsp; Isopel Berners is not so easy to settle;
yet the picture of her is so convincing, and Borrow was unable to
do more than colour his narrative, that she too must have
existed.</p>
<p>The failure of <i>Lavengro</i> is easily accounted for.&nbsp;
Borrow wrote of vagabonds and vagabondage; it did not mitigate
his offence in the eyes of the critics or the public that he
wrote well about them.&nbsp; His crime lay in his subject.&nbsp;
To Borrow, a man must be ready and able to knock another man down
if necessity arise.&nbsp; When nearing sixty he lamented his
childless state and said very mournfully: &ldquo;I shall soon not
be able to knock a man down, and I have no son to do it for
me.&rdquo; <a name="citation398"></a><a href="#footnote398"
class="citation">[398]</a>&nbsp; He glorified the bruisers of
England, in the face of horrified public opinion.&nbsp; England
had become ashamed of its bruisers long before <i>Lavengro</i>
was written, and this flaunting in its face of creatures that it
considered too low to be mentioned, gave mortal offence.&nbsp;
That in <i>Lavengro</i> was the best descriptions of a fight in
the language, only made the matter worse.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
was an age of gentility and refinement, and he outraged it, first
by glorifying vagabondage, secondly by decrying and sneering at
gentility.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Qui n&rsquo; a pas l&rsquo;esprit de son
&acirc;ge,<br />
De son &acirc;ge a tout le malheur.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Borrow proved Voltaire&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand that an age in which
prize-fighting is anathema should not tolerate a book glorifying
the ring; but it is strange that Borrow&rsquo;s simple paganism
and nature-worship should not have aroused sympathetic
recognition.&nbsp; Poetry is ageless, and such passages as the
description of the sunrise over Stonehenge should have found
some, at least, to welcome them, even when found in juxtaposition
with bruisers and gypsies.</p>
<p>Borrow loved to mystify, but in <i>Lavengro</i> he had
overreached himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you really in
existence?&rdquo; wrote one correspondent who was unknown to
Borrow, &ldquo;for I also have occasionally doubted whether
things exist, as you describe your own feelings in former
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Murray wrote (8th Nov. 1851):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was reminded of you the other day by an
enquiry after <i>Lavengro</i> and its author, made by the Right
Honourable John Wilson Croker. <a name="citation399a"></a><a
href="#footnote399a" class="citation">[399a]</a>&nbsp; Knowing
how fastidious and severe a critic he is, I was particularly glad
to find him expressing a favourable opinion of it; and thinking
well of it his curiosity was piqued about you.&nbsp; Like all the
rest of the world, he is mystified by it.&nbsp; He knew not
whether to regard it as truth or fiction.&nbsp; How can you
remedy this defect?&nbsp; I call it a defect, because it really
impedes your popularity.&nbsp; People say of a chapter or of a
character: &lsquo;This is very wonderful, <i>if true</i>; but if
fiction it is pointless.&rsquo;&mdash;Will your new volumes
explain this and dissolve the mystery?&nbsp; If so, pray make
haste and get on with them.&nbsp; I hope you have employed the
summer in giving them the finishing touches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; says a distinguished critic, <a
name="citation399b"></a><a href="#footnote399b"
class="citation">[399b]</a> &ldquo;passages in <i>Lavengro</i>
which are unsurpassed in the prose literature of
England&mdash;unsurpassed, I mean, for mere perfection of
style&mdash;for blending of strength and graphic power with
limpidity and music of flow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s own
generation would have laughed at such a value being put upon
anything in <i>Lavengro</i>.</p>
<p>Another thing against the books success was its style.&nbsp;
It lacked what has been described as the poetic ecstacy or
sentimental verdure of the age.&nbsp; Trope, imagery,
mawkishness, were all absent, for Borrow had gone back to his
masters, at whose head stood the glorious Defoe.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s style was as individual as the man himself.&nbsp;
By a curious contradiction, the tendency is to overlook literary
lapses in the very man towards whom so little latitude was
allowed in other directions.&nbsp; Many Borrovians have groaned
in anguish over his misuse of that wretched word
&ldquo;Individual.&rdquo;&nbsp; A distinguished man of letters <a
name="citation400a"></a><a href="#footnote400a"
class="citation">[400a]</a> has written:&mdash;&ldquo;I would as
lief read a chapter of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> as I would
<i>Gil Blas</i>; nay, I positively would give the preference to
Se&ntilde;or Giorgio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another critic, and a severe
one, has written:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not as philologist, or traveller, or
wild missionary, or folk-lorist, or antiquary, that Borrow lives
and will live.&nbsp; It is as the master of splendid, strong,
simple English, the prose Morland of a vanished road-side life,
the realist who, Defoe-like, could make fiction seem truer than
fact.&nbsp; To have written the finest fight in the whole
world&rsquo;s literature, the fight with the Flaming Tinman, is
surely something of an achievement.&rdquo; <a
name="citation400b"></a><a href="#footnote400b"
class="citation">[400b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Borrow&rsquo;s personality that looms out from his
pages.&nbsp; His mastery over the imagination of his reader, his
subtle instinct of how to throw his own magnetism over everything
he relates, although he may be standing aside as regards the
actual events with which he is dealing, is worthy of Defoe
himself.&nbsp; It is this magnetism that carries his readers
safely over the difficult places, where, but for the
author&rsquo;s grip upon them, they would give up in despair; it
is this magnetism that prompts them to pass by only with a slight
shudder, such references as the feathered tribe, fast in the arms
of Morpheus, and, above all, those terrible puns that crop up
from time to time.&nbsp; There is always the strong, masterful
man behind the words who, like a great general, can turn a
reverse to his own advantage.</p>
<p>In his style perhaps, after all, lay the secret of
Borrow&rsquo;s unsuccess.&nbsp; He was writing for another
generation; speaking in a voice too strong to be heard other than
as a strange noise by those near to him.&nbsp; It may be urged
that <i>The Bible in Spain</i> disproves these conclusions; but
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> was a peculiar book.&nbsp; It was a
chronicle of Christian enterprise served up with <i>sauce
picaresque</i>.&nbsp; It pleased and astonished everyone,
especially those who had grown a little weary of godly
missioners.&nbsp; It had the advantage of being spontaneous,
having been largely written on the spot, whereas <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>The Romany Rye</i> were worked on and laboured at for
years.&nbsp; Above all, it had the inestimable virtue of being
known to be True.&nbsp; To the imaginative intellectual, Truth or
Fiction are matters of small importance, he judges by Art; but to
the general public of limited intellectual capacity, Truth is
appreciated out of all proportion to its artistic
importance.&nbsp; If Borrow had published <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> after the failure of <i>Lavengro</i>, it would in all
probability have been as successful as it was appearing
before.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
SEPTEMBER 1849&ndash;FEBRUARY 1854</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the finest traits in
Borrow&rsquo;s character was his devotion to his mother.&nbsp; He
was always thoughtful for her comfort, even when fighting that
almost hopeless battle in Russia, and later in the midst of
bandits and bloody patriots in Spain.&nbsp; She was now, in 1849,
an old woman, too feeble to live alone, and it was decided to
transfer her to Oulton.&nbsp; An addition to the Hall was
constructed for her accommodation, and she was to be given an
attendant-companion in the person of the daughter of a local
farmer.</p>
<p>For thirty-three years she had lived in the little house in
Willow Lane; yet it was not she, but Borrow, who felt the parting
from old associations.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she writes to
her daughter-in-law on 16th September 1849, &ldquo;my dear George
would not have such fancies about <i>the old house</i>; it is a
mercy it has not fallen on my head before this.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old lady was anxious to get away.&nbsp; It would not be safe, she
thought, for her to be shut up alone, as the old woman who had
looked after her could, for some reason or other, do so no
longer.&nbsp; She urges her daughter-in-law to represent this to
Borrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a low, noisy set close to
me,&rdquo; she continues.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not die one day
sooner, or live one day longer.&nbsp; If I stop here and die on a
sudden, half the things might be lost or stolen, therefore it
seems as if the Lord would provide me a <i>safer home</i>.&nbsp;
I have made up my mind to the change and only pray that I may be
able to get through the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the move, which took place at the end of
September, was brought about by the old lady&rsquo;s appeals and
insistence, and that Borrow himself was not anxious for it.&nbsp;
He felt a sentimental attachment to the old place, which for so
many years had been a home to him.</p>
<p>In 1853 Borrow removed to Great Yarmouth.&nbsp; During the
summer of that year, Dr Hake had peremptorily ordered Mrs George
Borrow not to spend the ensuing winter and spring at Oulton, and
the move was made in August.&nbsp; The change was found to be
beneficial to Mrs Borrow and agreeable to all, and for the next
seven years (Aug. 1853&ndash;June 1860) Borrow&rsquo;s
headquarters were to be at Great Yarmouth, where he and his
family occupied various lodgings.</p>
<p>Shortly before leaving Oulton, Borrow had received the
following interesting letter from FitzGerald:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Boulge</span>, <span
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, 22nd <i>July</i> 1853.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I take the
liberty of sending you a book [Six Dramas from Calderon], of
which the title-page and advertisement will sufficiently explain
the import.&nbsp; I am afraid that I shall in general be set down
at once as an impudent fellow in making so free with a Great Man;
but, as usual, I shall feel least fear before a man like
yourself, who both do fine things in your own language and are
deep read in those of others.&nbsp; I mean, that whether you like
or not what I send you, you will do so from knowledge and in the
candour which knowledge brings.</p>
<p>I had even a mind to ask you to look at these plays before
they were printed, relying on our common friend Donne for a
mediator; but I know how wearisome all MS. inspection is; and,
after all, the whole affair was not worth giving you such a
trouble.&nbsp; You must pardon all this, and believe
me,&mdash;Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Edward FitzGerald</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after his arrival by the sea, Borrow performed an act of
bravery of which <i>The Bury Post</i> (17th Sept. 1852) gave the
following account, most likely written by Dr Hake:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>.&mdash;Yarmouth jetty presented
an extra-ordinary and thrilling spectacle on Thursday, the 8th
inst., about one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The sea raged frantically,
and a ship&rsquo;s boat, endeavouring to land for water, was
upset, and the men were engulfed in a wave some thirty feet high,
and struggling with it in vain.&nbsp; The moment was an awful
one, when George Borrow, the well-known author <i>of
Lavengro</i>, and <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, dashed into the surf
and saved one life, and through his instrumentality the others
were saved.&nbsp; We ourselves have known this brave and gifted
man for years, and, daring as was this deed we have known him
more than once to risk his life for others.&nbsp; We are happy to
add that he has sustained no material injury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was a splendid swimmer. <a name="citation404a"></a><a
href="#footnote404a" class="citation">[404a]</a>&nbsp; In the
course of one of his country walks with Robert Cooke (John
Murray&rsquo;s partner), with whom he was on very friendly
terms,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;he suggested a bathe in the river along
which they were walking.&nbsp; Mr Cooke told me that Borrow,
having stripped, took a header into the water and
disappeared.&nbsp; More than a minute had elapsed, and as there
were no signs of his whereabouts, Mr Cooke was becoming alarmed,
lest he had struck his head or been entangled in the weeds, when
Borrow suddenly reappeared a considerable distance off, under the
opposite bank of the stream, and called out &lsquo;What do you
think of that?&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation404b"></a><a
href="#footnote404b" class="citation">[404b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth Harvey, in telling the same story, says that on
coming up he exclaimed: &ldquo;There, if that had been written in
one of my books, they would have said it was a lie,
wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; <a name="citation404c"></a><a
href="#footnote404c" class="citation">[404c]</a></p>
<p>The paragraph about Borrow&rsquo;s courage was printed in
various newspapers throughout the country, amongst others in the
<i>Plymouth Mail</i> under the heading of &ldquo;Gallant Conduct
of Mr G. Borrow,&rdquo; and was read by Borrow&rsquo;s Cornish
kinsmen, who for years had heard nothing of Thomas Borrow.&nbsp;
Apparently quite convinced that George was his son, they deputed
Robert Taylor, a farmer of Penquite Farm (who had married Anne
Borrow, granddaughter of Henry Borrow), to write to Borrow and
invite him to visit Trethinnick.&nbsp; The letter was dated 10th
October and directed to &ldquo;George Borrow,
Yarmouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow replied as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Yarmouth</span>, 14<i>th</i> <i>Octr.</i>,
1853.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg leave to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. in which
you inform me of the kind desire of my Cornish relatives to see
me at Trethinnock (sic).&nbsp; Please to inform them that I shall
be proud and happy to avail myself of their kindness and to make
the acquaintance of &ldquo;one and all&rdquo; <a
name="citation405"></a><a href="#footnote405"
class="citation">[405]</a> of them.&nbsp; My engagements will
prevent my visiting them at present, but I will appear amongst
them on the first opportunity.&nbsp; I am delighted to learn that
there are still some living at Trethinnock who remember my
honoured father, who had as true a Cornish heart as ever
beat.</p>
<p>I am at present at Yarmouth, to which place I have brought my
wife for the benefit of her health; but my residence is Oulton
Hall, Lowestoft, Suffolk.&nbsp; With kind greetings to my Cornish
kindred, in which my wife and my mother join,&mdash;I remain, my
dear Sir, ever sincerely yours,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was not free to visit his kinsfolk until the following
Christmas.&nbsp; First advising Robert Taylor of his intention,
and receiving his approval and instructions for the journey,
Borrow set out from Great Yarmouth on 23rd December.&nbsp; He
spent the night at Plymouth.&nbsp; Next morning on finding the
Liskeard coach full, he decided to walk.&nbsp; Leaving his
carpet-bag to be sent on by the mail, and throwing over his arm
the cloak that had seen many years of service, he set out upon
his eighteen-mile tramp.&nbsp; He arrived at Liskeard in the
afternoon, and was met by his cousin Henry Borrow and Robert
Taylor, as well as by several local celebrities.</p>
<p>After tea Borrow, accompanied by Robert Taylor, rode to
Penquite, four miles away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ride by night to
Penquite, Borrow records in his <i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; House of
stone and slate on side of a hill.&nbsp; Mrs Taylor.&nbsp;
Hospitable reception.&nbsp; Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Log on
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found alive of his own generation, Henry,
William, Thomas, Elizabeth (who lived to be 94 years of age) and
Nicholas, the children of Henry Borrow, Captain Borrow&rsquo;s
eldest brother.&nbsp; Also Anne, daughter of Henry, who married
Robert Taylor, and their daughter, likewise named Anne, and
William Henry, son of Nicholas.</p>
<p>In the Cornish Note Books there appears under the date of 3rd
January the following entry: &ldquo;Rain and snow.&nbsp; Rode
with Mr Taylor to dine at Trethinnick.&nbsp; House
dilapidated.&nbsp; A family party.&nbsp; Hospitable
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; On first entering his father&rsquo;s old
home tears had sprung to Borrow&rsquo;s eyes, and he was much
affected.&nbsp; There was present at the dinner the vicar of St
Cleer, the Rev. J. R. P. Berkeley, a pleasant Irish clergyman
who, years later, was able to give to Dr Knapp an account of what
took place.&nbsp; He noticed the &ldquo;vast difference in
appearance and manners between the simple yet shrewd Cornish
farmers and the betravelled gentleman their kinsman;&rdquo; yet
for all this there were shades of resemblance&mdash;in a look,
some turn of thought or tone of voice.&nbsp; George Borrow was
not at his best that evening, Mr Berkeley relates of the dinner
at Trethinnick:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;his feelings were too much excited.&nbsp;
He was thinking of the time when his father&rsquo;s footsteps and
his father&rsquo;s voice re-echoed in the room in which we were
sitting.&nbsp; His eyes wandered from point to point, and at
times, if I was not mistaken, a tear could be seen trembling in
them.&nbsp; At length he could no longer control his
feelings.&nbsp; He left the hall suddenly, and in a few moments,
but for God&rsquo;s providential care, the career of George
Borrow would have been ended.&nbsp; There was within a few feet
of the house a low wall with a drop of some feet into a paved
yard.&nbsp; He walked rapidly out, and, it being nearly dark, he
stepped one side of the gate and fell over the wall.&nbsp; He did
not mention the accident, although he bruised himself a good
deal, and it was some days before I heard of it.&nbsp; His words
to me that evening, when bidding me good-bye, were: &lsquo;Well,
we have shared the old-fashioned hospitality of old-fashioned
people in an old-fashioned house.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation407a"></a><a href="#footnote407a"
class="citation">[407a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow created something of a sensation in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; As a celebrity his autograph was much sought
after; but he would gratify nobody.&nbsp; His hosts experienced
many little surprises from their guest&rsquo;s strange
ways.&nbsp; He would plunge into a moorland pool to fetch a bird
that had fallen to his gun, or, round the family fireside, he
would shout his ballads of the North, at one time alarming his
audience by seizing a carving-knife and brandishing it about in
the air to emphasize the passionate nature of his song.&nbsp;
When a card-party proved too dull he slipped off and found his
way into some slums, picking up all the disreputable characters
he could find, working off his knowledge of cant on them, and
getting out of them what he could. <a name="citation407b"></a><a
href="#footnote407b" class="citation">[407b]</a></p>
<p>On one occasion when dining at the house of a local celebrity
he was suddenly missed from table during dessert.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A search revealed him in a remote room
surrounded by the children of the house, whom he was amusing by
his stories and catechising in the subject of their studies and
pursuits.&nbsp; He excused his absence by saying that he had been
fascinated by the intelligence of the children, and had forgotten
about the dinner.&rdquo; <a name="citation407c"></a><a
href="#footnote407c" class="citation">[407c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His hatred of gentility led him into some actions that can
only be characterised as childish.&nbsp; Even in Cornwall he was
on the lookout for his fetish.&nbsp; On one occasion when dining
with the ex-Mayor of Liskeard, he pulled out of his pocket and
used instead of a handkerchief, a dirty old grease-stained rag
with which he was wont to clean his gun. <a
name="citation408"></a><a href="#footnote408"
class="citation">[408]</a>&nbsp; This was done as a protest
against something or other that seemed to him to suggest mock
refinement.</p>
<p>When at Wolsdon as the guest of the Pollards there arrived a
lady and gentleman of the name of Hambly, according to the Note
Books.&nbsp; In spite of this brief reference, Borrow immediately
recognised a hated name.&nbsp; Never was one of the name good, he
informed Mr Berkeley.&nbsp; He may even have been informed that
they were descendants of the Headborough whom his father had
knocked down.&nbsp; He showed his detestation for the name by
being as rude as he could to those who bore it.</p>
<p>Borrow was as incapable of dissimulating his dislikes as he
was of controlling his moods.&nbsp; Even during his short stay at
Penquite he was on one occasion, at least, plunged into a deep
melancholy, sitting before a huge fire entirely oblivious to the
presence of others in the room.&nbsp; Mrs Berkeley, who, with the
vicar himself, was a caller, thinking to produce some good effect
upon the gloomy man, sat down at the piano and played some old
Irish and Scottish airs.&nbsp; After a time Borrow began to
listen, then he raised his head, and finally &ldquo;he suddenly
sprang to his feet, clapped his hands several times, danced about
the room, and struck up some joyous melody.&nbsp; From that
moment he was a different man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told them
&ldquo;tales and side-splitting anecdotes,&rdquo; he joined the
party at supper, and when the vicar and his wife rose to take
their leave he pressed Mrs Berkeley&rsquo;s hands, and told her
that her music had been as David&rsquo;s harp to his soul.</p>
<p>To the young man he met during this visit who informed him
that he had left the Army as it was no place for a gentleman,
Borrow replied that it was no place for a man who was not a
gentleman, and that he was quite right in leaving it.&nbsp; To
speak against the Army to Borrow was to speak against his
honoured father.</p>
<p>How Borrow struck his Cornish kinsfolk is shown in a letter
written by his hostess to a friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must tell
you,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;a bit about our distinguished
visitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gives one of the most valuable
portraits of Borrow that exists.&nbsp; He was to her:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A fine tall man of about six feet three,
well-proportioned and not stout; able to walk five miles an hour
successively; rather florid face without any hirsute appendages;
hair white and soft; eyes and eyebrows dark; good nose and very
nice mouth; well-shaped hands&mdash;altogether a person you would
notice in a crowd.&nbsp; His character is not so easy to
portray.&nbsp; The more I see of him the less I know of
him.&nbsp; He is very enthusiastic and eccentric, very proud and
unyielding.&nbsp; He says very little of himself, and one cannot
ask him if inclined to . . . He is a marvel in himself.&nbsp;
There is no one here to draw him out.&nbsp; He has an astonishing
memory as to dates when great events have taken place, no matter
in what part of the world.&nbsp; He seems to know
everything.&rdquo; <a name="citation409"></a><a
href="#footnote409" class="citation">[409]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was gratified at the welcome he received, and was much
pleased with the neighbourhood and its people.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
relations are most excellent people,&rdquo; he wrote to his wife,
&ldquo;but I could not understand more than half they
said.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was puzzled to know why the head of a
family, which was reputed to be worth seventy thousand pounds,
should live in a house which could not boast of a single
grate&mdash;&ldquo;nothing but open chimneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained at Penquite for upwards of a fortnight, at one
time galloping over snowy hills and dales with Anne Taylor,
Junr., &ldquo;as gallant a girl as ever rode,&rdquo; at another,
alert as ever for fragments of folk-lore or philology, jotting
down the story of a pisky-child from the dictation of his cousin
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>On 9th January Borrow left Penquite on a tour to Truro,
Penzance, Mousehole, and Land&rsquo;s End, armed with the
inevitable umbrella, grasped in the centre by the right hand,
green, manifold and bulging, that so puzzled Mr Watts-Dunton and
caused him on one occasion to ask Dr Hake, &ldquo;Is he a genuine
Child of the Open Air?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was one of the first
things to which Borrow&rsquo;s pedestrian friends had to accustom
themselves.&nbsp; With this &ldquo;damning thing . . . gigantic
and green,&rdquo; Borrow set out upon his excursion, now
examining some Celtic barrow, now enquiring his way or the name
of a landmark, occasionally singing in that tremendous voice of
his, &ldquo;Look out, look out, Swayne Vonved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Mousehole he called upon a relative, H. D. Burney (who was,
it would seem, in charge of the Coast Guard Station), to whom he
had a letter of introduction from Robert Taylor.&nbsp; Mr Burney
entertained him with stories, showed him places and things of
interest in the neighbourhood, and accompanied him on his visit
to St Michael&rsquo;s Mount.&nbsp; Borrow returned to Penquite on
the 25th with a considerable store of Cornish legends and Cornish
words, and the knowledge that you can only see Cornwall or know
anything about it by walking through it.</p>
<p>The next excursion was to the North Coast, Pentire Point,
Tintagel, King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle, etc.&nbsp; On the 1st of
February he left Penquite, and slept the night at
Trethinnick.&nbsp; The next morning he set out on horseback
accompanied by Nicholas Borrow.</p>
<p>To the vicar of St Cleer and his family, Borrow was a very
welcome visitor.&nbsp; Mr Berkeley&rsquo;s eldest son, a boy of
ten years of age, on being introduced to the distinguished
caller, gazed at him for some moments and then without a word
left the room and, going straight to his mother in another
apartment cried, &ldquo;Well, mother, that <i>is</i> a
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was delighted when he heard of the
child&rsquo;s enthusiasm.&nbsp; Mr Berkeley give a picture of his
distinguished visitor far more prepossessing than many that
exist.&nbsp; He was particularly struck, as was everybody, by the
beauty of Borrow&rsquo;s hands, and their owner&rsquo;s vanity
over them as the legacy of his Huguenot ancestors.&nbsp; Mr
Berkeley found Borrow&rsquo;s countenance pleasing, betokening
calm firmness, self-confidence and a mind under control, though
capable of passion.&nbsp; He could on occasion prove a delightful
talker, and he gave to the vicar&rsquo;s family a new maxim to
implant upon their Christianity, the old prize-fighters receipt
for a quiet life: &ldquo;Learn to box, and keep a civil tongue in
your head.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would often drop in at the vicarage in
the evening, when he would</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;sit in the centre of a group before the
fire with his hands on his knees&mdash;his favourite
position&mdash;pouring forth tales of the scenes he had witnessed
in his wanderings. . . . Then he would suddenly spring from his
seat and walk to and fro the room in silence; anon he would clap
his hands and sing a Gypsy song, or perchance would chant forth a
translation of some Viking poem; after which he would sit down
again and chat about his father, whose memory he revered as he
did his mother&rsquo;s; <a name="citation411"></a><a
href="#footnote411" class="citation">[411]</a> and finally he
would recount some tale of suffering or sorrow with deep
pathos&mdash;his voice being capable of expressing triumphant joy
or the profoundest sadness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Borrow&rsquo;s intention to write a book about his
visit to Cornwall, and he even announced it at the end of <i>The
Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; He was delighted with the Duchy, and
evidently gave his relatives to understand that it was his
intention to use the contents of his Note Books as the nucleus of
a book.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will undoubtedly write a description of
his visit,&rdquo; Mrs Taylor wrote to her friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
walked through the whole of Cornwall and saw everything,&rdquo;
Borrow wrote to his wife after his return to London.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I kept a Journal of every day I was there, and it fills
<i>two</i> pocket books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow left Cornwall the second week in February and was in
London on the 10th, where he was to break his journey home in
order to obtain some data at the British Museum for the Appendix
of <i>The Romany Rye</i>. <a name="citation412a"></a><a
href="#footnote412a" class="citation">[412a]</a>&nbsp; On 13th
February he writes to his wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For three days I have been working hard at
the Museum, I am at present at Mr Webster&rsquo;s, but not in the
three guinea lodgings.&nbsp; I am in rooms above, for which I pay
thirty shillings a week.&nbsp; I live as economically as I can;
but when I am in London I am obliged to be at certain
expense.&nbsp; I must be civil to certain friends who invite me
out and show me every kindness.&nbsp; Please send me a five pound
note by return of post.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His wife appears to have been anxious for his return home, and
on the 17th he writes to her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is hardly worth while making me more
melancholy than I am.&nbsp; Come home, come home! is the
cry.&nbsp; And what are my prospects when I get home? though it
is true that they are not much brighter here.&nbsp; I have
nothing to look forward to.&nbsp; Honourable employments are
being given to this and that trumpery fellow; while I, who am an
honourable man, must be excluded from everything.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of literature he expressed himself as tired, there was little
or nothing to be got out of it, save by writing humbug, which he
refused to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;My spirits are very low,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;and your letters make them worse.&nbsp; I shall
probably return by the end of next week; but I shall want more
money.&nbsp; I am sorry to spend money for it is our only friend,
and God knows I use as little as possible, but I can&rsquo;t
travel without it.&rdquo; <a name="citation412b"></a><a
href="#footnote412b" class="citation">[412b]</a>&nbsp; A few days
later there is another letter with farther reference to money,
and protests that he is spending as little as possible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps you had better send another note,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;and I will bring it home unchanged, if I do not
want any part of it.&nbsp; I have lived very economically as far
as I am concerned personally; I have bought nothing, and have
been working hard at the Museum.&rdquo; <a
name="citation413"></a><a href="#footnote413"
class="citation">[413]</a></p>
<p>These constant references to money seem to suggest either some
difference between Borrow and his wife, or that he felt he was
spending too much upon himself and was anticipating her thoughts
by assuring her of how economically he was living.&nbsp; He had
an unquestioned right to spend, for he had added considerable
sums to the exchequer from the profits of his first two
books.</p>
<p>Borrow returned to Yarmouth on 25th February.&nbsp; <i>The
Romany Rye</i> was now rapidly nearing completion; but there was
no encouragement to publish a new book.&nbsp; He worked at <i>The
Romany Rye</i>, not because he saw profit in it, not because he
was anxious to give another book to an uneager public; but
because of the sting in its tail, because of the thunderbolt
Appendix in which he paid off old scores against the critics and
his personal enemies.&nbsp; <i>The Romany Rye</i> was to him a
work of hate; it was a bomb disguised as a book, which he
intended to throw into the camp of his foes.&nbsp; He was tired
of literature, by which he meant that he was tired of producing
his best for a public that neither wanted nor understood
it.&nbsp; He forgot that the works of a great writer are
sometimes printed in his own that they may be read in another
generation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
MARCH 1854&ndash;MAY 1856</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the months that followed
Borrow&rsquo;s return to Great Yarmouth, the question of the
coming summer holiday was discussed.&nbsp; From the first Borrow
himself had been for Wales.&nbsp; He was eager to pursue his
Celtic researches further north.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should not wonder
if he went into Wales before he returns,&rdquo; Mrs Robert Taylor
had written to her friend during Borrow&rsquo;s stay in
Cornwall.&nbsp; His wife and Henrietta had &ldquo;a hankering
after what is fashionable,&rdquo; and suggested Harrogate or
Leamington.&nbsp; To which Borrow replied that there was nothing
he &ldquo;so much hated as fashionable life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He,
however, gave way, the two women followed suit, as he had
intended they should, and Wales was decided upon.&nbsp; For
Borrow the literature of Wales had always exercised a great
attraction.&nbsp; Her bards were as no other bards.&nbsp; Ab
Gwilym was to him the superior of Chaucer, and Huw Morris
&ldquo;the greatest songster of the seventeenth
century.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, he confessed, a desire to put to
practical use his knowledge of the Welsh tongue, &ldquo;such as
it was,&rdquo; that first gave him the idea of going to
Wales.</p>
<p>The party left Great Yarmouth on 27th July 1854, spending one
night at Peterborough and three at Chester.&nbsp; They reached
Llangollen, which was to be their head-quarters, on 1st
August.&nbsp; On 9th August Mrs George Borrow wrote to the old
lady at Oulton, &ldquo;We all much enjoy this wonderful and
beautiful country.&nbsp; We are in a lovely quiet spot.&nbsp;
Dear George goes out exploring the mountains, and when he finds
remarkable views takes us of an evening to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow wanted to see Wales and get to know the people, and,
above all, to speak with them in their own language, and on 27th
August he started upon a walking tour to Bangor, where he was to
meet his wife and Henrietta, who were to proceed thither by
rail.&nbsp; It was during this excursion that he encountered the
delightful Papist-Orange fiddler, whose fortunes and fingers
fluctuated between &ldquo;Croppies Get Up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Croppies Lie Down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Bangor Borrow explored the surrounding places of
interest.&nbsp; He ascended Snowdon arm-in-arm with Henrietta,
singing &ldquo;at the stretch of my voice a celebrated Welsh
stanza,&rdquo; the boy-guide following wonderingly behind.&nbsp;
In spite of the fatigues of the climb, &ldquo;the gallant
girl&rdquo; reached the summit and heard her stepfather declaim
two stanzas of poetry in Welsh, to the grinning astonishment of a
small group of English tourists and the great interest of a
Welshman, who asked Borrow if he were <i>a Breton</i>.</p>
<p>There is no question that Borrow was genuinely attached to
Henrietta.&nbsp; &ldquo;I generally call her daughter,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;and with good reason, seeing that she has always
shown herself a daughter to me&mdash;that she has all kinds of
good qualities, and several accomplishments, knowing something of
conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the Dutch
style,&rdquo; <a name="citation415a"></a><a href="#footnote415a"
class="citation">[415a]</a> not to speak of her ability to play
on the Spanish guitar.&nbsp; She was &ldquo;the dear girl,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the gallant girl,&rdquo; between whom and her
stepfather existed a true spirit of comradeship.&nbsp; In 1844
she wrote to him, &ldquo;And then that <i>funny</i> look <a
name="citation415b"></a><a href="#footnote415b"
class="citation">[415b]</a> would come into your eyes and you
would call me &lsquo;poor old Hen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed
incapable of laughing, and one intimate friend states that she
&ldquo;never saw him even smiling, but there was a twinkle in his
eyes which told you that he was enjoying himself just the
same.&rdquo; <a name="citation416"></a><a href="#footnote416"
class="citation">[416]</a></p>
<p>About this time Mrs George Borrow wrote to old Mrs Borrow at
Oulton Hall, saying that all was well with her son.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is very regular in his morning and
evening devotions, so that we all have abundant cause for
thankfulness . . . As regards your dear son and his peace and
comfort, you have reason to praise and bless God on his account .
. . He is fully occupied.&nbsp; He keeps a <i>daily</i> Journal
of all that goes on, so that he can make a most amusing book in a
month, whenever he wishes to do so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence is very puzzling, and would seem to suggest
that Borrow&rsquo;s moods were somehow or other associated with
outbursts against religion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be sure you <i>burn</i>
this, or do not leave it about,&rdquo; the old lady is
admonished.</p>
<p>On the day following the ascent of Snowdon, Mrs Borrow and
Henrietta returned to Llangollen by train, leaving Borrow free to
pursue his wanderings.&nbsp; He eventually arrived at Llangollen
on 6th September, by way of Carnarvon, Festiniog and Bala.&nbsp;
After remaining another twenty days at Llangollen, he despatched
his wife and stepdaughter home by rail.&nbsp; He then bought a
small leather satchel, with a strap to sling it over his
shoulder, packed in it a white linen shirt, a pair of worsted
stockings, a razor and a prayer-book.&nbsp; Having had his boots
resoled and his umbrella repaired, he left Llangollen for South
Wales, upon an excursion which was to occupy three weeks.&nbsp;
During the course of this expedition he was taken for many
things, from a pork-jobber to Father Toban himself, as whom he
pronounced &ldquo;the best Latin blessing I could remember&rdquo;
over two or three dozen Irish reapers to their entire
satisfaction.&nbsp; Eventually he arrived at Chepstow, having
learned a great deal about wild Wales.</p>
<p>One of the excursions that Borrow made from Bangor was to
Llanfair in search of Gronwy, the birthplace of Gronwy
Owen.&nbsp; He found in the long, low house an old woman and five
children, descendants of the poet, who stared at him
wonderingly.&nbsp; To each he gave a trifle.&nbsp; Asking whether
they could read, he was told that the eldest could read anything,
whether Welsh or English.&nbsp; In <i>Wild Wales</i> he gives an
account of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you write?&rsquo; said I to the
child [the eldest], a little stubby girl of about eight, with a
broad flat red face and grey eyes, dressed in a chintz gown, a
little bonnet on her head, and looking the image of
notableness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little maiden, who had never taken her eyes off of
me for a moment during the whole time I had been in the room, at
first made no answer; being, however, bid by her grandmother to
speak, she at length answered in a soft voice, &lsquo;Medraf, I
can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then write your name in this book,&rsquo; said
I, taking out a pocket-book and a pencil, &lsquo;and write
likewise that you are related to Gronwy Owen&mdash;and be sure
you write in Welsh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little maiden very demurely took the book and
pencil, and placing the former on the table wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ellen Jones yn perthyn o bell i gronow
owen.&rsquo; <a name="citation417a"></a><a href="#footnote417a"
class="citation">[417a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, &lsquo;Ellen Jones belonging, from afar off to
Gronwy Owen.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation417b"></a><a
href="#footnote417b" class="citation">[417b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellen Jones is now Ellen Thomas, and she well remembers Borrow
coming along the lane, where she was playing with some other
children, and asking for the house of Gronwy Owen.&nbsp; Later,
when she entered the house, she found him talking to her
grandmother, who was a little deaf as described in <i>Wild
Wales</i>.&nbsp; Mrs Thomas&rsquo; recollection of Borrow is that
he had the appearance of possessing great strength.&nbsp; He had
&ldquo;bright eyes and shabby dress, more like a merchant than a
gentleman, or like a man come to buy cattle [others made the same
mistake].&nbsp; But, dear me! he did speak <i>funny</i>
Welsh,&rdquo; she remarked to a student of Borrow who sought her
out, &ldquo;he could not pronounce the &lsquo;ll&rsquo;
[pronouncing the word &ldquo;pell&rdquo; as if it rhymed with
tell, whereas it should be pronounced something like
&ldquo;pelth&rdquo;], and his voice was very high; but perhaps
that was because my grandmother was deaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
plenty of words, but bad pronunciation.&nbsp; William Thomas <a
name="citation418a"></a><a href="#footnote418a"
class="citation">[418a]</a> laughed many a time at him coming
talking his funny Welsh to him, and said he was glad he knew a
few words of Spanish to answer him with.&nbsp; Borrow was,
apparently, unconscious of any imperfection in his pronunciation
of the &ldquo;ll&rdquo;.&nbsp; He has written: &ldquo;&lsquo;Had
you much difficulty in acquiring the sound of the
&ldquo;ll&rdquo;?&rsquo;&nbsp; I think I hear the reader
inquire.&nbsp; None whatever: the double l of the Welsh is by no
means the terrible guttural which English people generally
suppose it to be.&rdquo; <a name="citation418b"></a><a
href="#footnote418b" class="citation">[418b]</a></p>
<p>Mrs Thomas is now sixty-seven years of age (she was eleven and
not eight at the time of Borrow&rsquo;s visit) and still
preserves carefully wrapped up the book from which she read to
the white-haired stranger.&nbsp; The episode was not thought much
of at the time, except by the child, whom it much excited. <a
name="citation418c"></a><a href="#footnote418c"
class="citation">[418c]</a></p>
<p>It was in all probability during this, his first tour in
Wales, that Borrow was lost on Cader Idris, and spent the whole
of one night in wandering over the mountain vainly seeking a
path.&nbsp; The next morning he arrived at the inn utterly
exhausted.&nbsp; It was quite in keeping with Borrow&rsquo;s
nature to suppress from his book all mention of this unpleasant
adventure. <a name="citation419a"></a><a href="#footnote419a"
class="citation">[419a]</a></p>
<p>The Welsh holiday was unquestionably a success.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s mind had been diverted from critics and his lost
popularity.&nbsp; He had forgotten that in official quarters he
had been overlooked.&nbsp; He was in the land of Ab Gwilym and
Gronwy Owen.&nbsp; &ldquo;There never was such a place for
poets,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;you meet a poet, or the birthplace
of a poet, everywhere.&rdquo; <a name="citation419b"></a><a
href="#footnote419b" class="citation">[419b]</a>&nbsp; He was
delighted with the simplicity of the people, and in no way
offended by their persistent suspicion of all things Saxon.&nbsp;
At least they knew their own poets; and he could not help
comparing the Welsh labouring man who knew Huw Morris, with his
Suffolk brother who had never heard of Beowulf or Chaucer.&nbsp;
He discoursed with many people about their bards, surprising them
by his intimate knowledge of the poets and the poetry of
Wales.&nbsp; He found enthusiasm &ldquo;never scoffed at by the
noble simple-minded genuine Welsh, whatever treatment it may
receive from the coarse-hearted, sensual, selfish Saxon.&rdquo;
<a name="citation419c"></a><a href="#footnote419c"
class="citation">[419c]</a>&nbsp; Sometimes he was reminded
&ldquo;of the substantial yoemen of Cornwall, particularly . . .
of my friends at Penquite.&rdquo; <a name="citation419d"></a><a
href="#footnote419d" class="citation">[419d]</a>&nbsp; Wherever
he went he experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality, and
it delighted him to be taken for a Cumro, as was frequently the
case.</p>
<p>What Borrow writes about his Welsh is rather
contradictory.&nbsp; Sometimes he represents himself as taken for
a Welshman, at others as a foreigner speaking Welsh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, what a blessing it is to be able to speak
Welsh!&rdquo; <a name="citation420a"></a><a href="#footnote420a"
class="citation">[420a]</a> he exclaims.&nbsp; He acknowledged
that he could read Welsh with far more ease than he could speak
it.&nbsp; There is absolutely no posing or endeavour to depict
himself a perfect Welsh scholar, whose accent could not be
distinguished from that of a native.&nbsp; The literary results
of the Welsh holiday were four Note Books written in pencil, from
which <i>Wild Wales</i> was subsequently written.&nbsp; Borrow
was in Wales for nearly sixteen weeks (1st Aug.&mdash;16th
November), of which about a third was devoted to expeditions on
foot.</p>
<p>In the annual consultations about holidays, Borrow&rsquo;s was
always the dominating voice.&nbsp; For the year 1855 the Isle of
Man was chosen, because it attracted him as a land of legend and
quaint customs and speech.&nbsp; Accordingly during the early
days of September Mrs Borrow and Henrietta were comfortably
settled at Douglas, and Borrow began to make excursions to
various parts of the island.&nbsp; He explored every corner of
it, conversing with the people in Manx, collecting ballads and
old, smoke-stained <i>carvel</i> <a name="citation420b"></a><a
href="#footnote420b" class="citation">[420b]</a> (or carol)
books, of which he was successful in securing two examples.&nbsp;
He discovered that the island possessed a veritable literature in
these <i>carvels</i>, which were circulated in manuscript form
among the neighbours of the writers.</p>
<p>The old runic inscriptions that he found on the tombstones
exercised a great fascination over Borrow.&nbsp; He would spend
hours, or even days (on one occasion as much as a week), in
deciphering one of them.&nbsp; Thirty years later he was
remembered as an accurate, painstaking man.&nbsp; His evenings
were frequently occupied in translating into English the Manx
poem <i>Illiam Dhoo</i>, or Brown William.&nbsp; He discovered
among the Manx traditions much about Finn Ma Coul, or
M&lsquo;Coyle, who appears in <i>The Romany Rye</i> as a
notability of Ireland.&nbsp; He ascended Snaefell, sought out the
daughter of George Killey, the Manx poet, and had much talk with
her, she taking him for a Manxman.&nbsp; The people of the island
he liked.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the whole world,&rdquo; he wrote in his
&lsquo;Note Books,&rsquo; &ldquo;there is not a more honest,
kindly race than the genuine Manx.&nbsp; Towards strangers they
exert unbounded hospitality without the slightest idea of
receiving any compensation, and they are, whether men or women,
at any time willing to go two or three miles over mountain and
bog to put strangers into the right road.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his stay in the Isle of Man, news reached Borrow of the
death of a kinsman, William, son of Samuel Borrow, his cousin, a
cooper at Devonport.&nbsp; William Borrow had gone to America,
where he had won a prize for a new and wonderful application of
steam.&nbsp; His death is said to have occurred as the result of
mental fatigue.&nbsp; In this Borrow saw cause for grave
complaint against the wretched English Aristocracy that forced
talent out of the country by denying it employment or honour,
which were all for their &ldquo;connections and
lick-spittles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The holiday in the Isle of Man had resulted in two quarto note
books, aggregating ninety-six pages, closely written in
pencil.&nbsp; Again Borrow planned to write a book, just as he
had done on the occasion of the Cornish visit.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, came of it.&nbsp; Among his papers was found the
following draft of a suggested title-page:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">BAYR JAIRGEY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
GLION DOO</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE RED PATH
AND THE BLACK VALLEY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">WANDERINGS
IN QUEST OF MANX LITERATURE</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A curious feature of Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s correspondence is her
friendly conspiracies, sometimes with John Murray, sometimes with
Woodfall, the printer, asking them to send encouraging letters
that shall hearten Borrow to greater efforts.&nbsp; On 26th
November 1850 John Murray wrote to her: &ldquo;I have determined
on engraving [by W. Holl] Phillips&rsquo; portrait <a
name="citation422"></a><a href="#footnote422"
class="citation">[422]</a> . . . as a frontispiece to it
[<i>Lavengro</i>].&nbsp; I trust that this will not be
disagreeable to you and the author&mdash;in fact I do it in
confident expectation that it will meet with <i>your</i> assent;
I do not ask Mr Borrow&rsquo;s leave, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that Mrs Borrow had been in London a
few days previously, in order to deliver to John Murray the
manuscript of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s reply to
this letter is significant.&nbsp; With regard to the engraving,
she writes (28th November), &ldquo;<i>I like the idea of it</i>,
and when Mr Borrow remarked that he did not wish it (as we
expected he would) I reminded him that <i>his</i> leave
<i>was</i> not asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, on 30th October 1852, Mrs Borrow wrote to Robert Cooke
asking that either he or John Murray would write to Borrow
enquiring as to his health, and progress with <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, and how long it would be before the manuscript were
ready for the printer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she adds,
&ldquo;all this is in perfect confidence to Mr Murray and
yourself as you <i>both</i> of you know my truly excellent
Husband well enough to be aware how much he every now and then
requires an impetus to cause the large wheel to move round at a
quicker pace . . . Oblige me by committing this to the flames,
and write to him just as you would have done, without hearing
<i>a word from me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On yet another occasion when
she and Borrow were both in London, she writes to Cooke asking
that either he &ldquo;or Mr Murray will give my Husband a look,
if it be only for a few minutes . . . He seems rather low.&nbsp;
Do, <i>not</i> let this note remain on your table,&rdquo; she
concludes, &ldquo;or <i>mention</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Borrow were a problem to his wife and to his publisher, he
presented equal difficulties to the country folk about
Oulton.&nbsp; To one he was &ldquo;a missionary out of
work,&rdquo; to another &ldquo;a man who kep&rsquo; &rsquo;isself
to &rsquo;isself&rdquo;; but to none was he the tired lion weary
of the chase.&nbsp; &ldquo;His great delight . . . was to plunge
into the darkening mere at eventide, his great head and heavy
shoulders ruddy in the rays of the sun.&nbsp; Here he hissed and
roared and spluttered, sometimes frightening the eel-catcher
sailing home in the half-light, and remembering suddenly school
legends of river-sprites and monsters of the deep.&rdquo; <a
name="citation423a"></a><a href="#footnote423a"
class="citation">[423a]</a></p>
<p>In the spring following his return from the Isle of Man,
Borrow made numerous excursions on foot through East
Anglia.&nbsp; He seemed too restless to remain long in one
place.&nbsp; During a tramp from Yarmouth to Ely by way of
Cromer, Holt, Lynn and Wisbech, he called upon Anna Gurney. <a
name="citation423b"></a><a href="#footnote423b"
class="citation">[423b]</a>&nbsp; His reason for doing so was
that she was one of the three celebrities of the world he desired
to see.&nbsp; The other two were Daniel O&rsquo;Connell <a
name="citation423c"></a><a href="#footnote423c"
class="citation">[423c]</a> and Lamplighter (the sire of
Phosphorus), Lord Berners winner of the Derby.&nbsp; Two of the
world&rsquo;s notabilities had slipped through his fingers by
reason of their deaths, but he was determined that Anna Gurney,
who lived at North Repps, should not evade him.&nbsp; He gave her
notice of his intention to call, and found her ready to receive
him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When, according to his account, <a
name="citation424"></a><a href="#footnote424"
class="citation">[424]</a> he had been but a very short time in
her presence, she wheeled her chair round and reached her hand to
one of her bookshelves and took down an Arabic grammar, and put
it into his hand, asking for explanation of some difficult point,
which he tried to decipher; but meanwhile she talked to him
continuously; when, said he, &lsquo;I could not study the Arabic
grammar and listen to her at the same time, so I threw down the
book and ran out of the room.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said that Borrow ran until he reached Old Tucker&rsquo;s
Inn at Cromer, where he ate &ldquo;five excellent sausages&rdquo;
and found calm.&nbsp; He then went on to Sheringham and related
the incident to the Upchers.</p>
<p>These lonely walking tours soothed Borrow&rsquo;s restless
mind.&nbsp; He had constant change of scene, and his thoughts
were diverted by the adventures of the roadside.&nbsp; He
encountered many and interesting people, on one occasion an old
man who remembered the fight between Painter and Oliver; at
another time he saw a carter beating his horse which had fallen
down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give him a pint of ale, and I will pay for
it,&rdquo; counselled Borrow.&nbsp; After the second pint the
beast got up and proceeded, &ldquo;pulling merrily . . . with the
other horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ale was Borrow&rsquo;s sovereign remedy for the world&rsquo;s
ills and wrongs.&nbsp; It was by ale that he had been cured when
the &ldquo;Horrors&rdquo; were upon him in the dingle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, genial and gladdening is the power of good ale, the
true and proper drink of Englishmen,&rdquo; he exclaims after
having heartened Jack Slingsby and his family.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
not deserving of the name of Englishman,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;who speaketh against ale, that is good ale.&rdquo; <a
name="citation425a"></a><a href="#footnote425a"
class="citation">[425a]</a>&nbsp; To John Murray (the Third) he
wrote in his letter of sympathy on the death of his father:
&ldquo;Pray keep up your spirits, and that you may be able to do
so, take long walks and drink plenty of Scotch ale with your
dinner . . .&nbsp; God bless you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He liked ale &ldquo;with plenty of malt in it, and as little
hop as well may be&mdash;ale at least two years old.&rdquo; <a
name="citation425b"></a><a href="#footnote425b"
class="citation">[425b]</a>&nbsp; The period of its maturity
changed with his mood.&nbsp; In another place he gives nine or
ten months as the ideal age. <a name="citation425c"></a><a
href="#footnote425c" class="citation">[425c]</a>&nbsp; He was all
for an Act of Parliament to force people to brew good ale.&nbsp;
He not only drank good ale himself; but prescribed it as a
universal elixir for man and beast.&nbsp; Hearing from Elizabeth
Harvey &ldquo;of a lady who was attached to a gentleman,&rdquo;
Borrow demanded bluntly, &ldquo;Well, did he make her an
offer?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the response.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Borrow replied with conviction, &ldquo;if she
had given him some good ale he would.&rdquo; <a
name="citation425d"></a><a href="#footnote425d"
class="citation">[425d]</a></p>
<p>He loved best old Burton, which, with &rsquo;37 port, were his
favourites; yet he would drink whatever ale the roadside-inn
provided, as if to discipline his stomach.&nbsp; It has been said
that he habitually drank &ldquo;swipes,&rdquo; a thin cheap ale,
because that was the drink of his gypsy friends; but
Borrow&rsquo;s friendship certainly did not often involve him in
anything so distasteful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<i>THE ROMANY RYE</i>.&nbsp; 1854&ndash;1859</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> was not a great
correspondent, and he left behind him very few letters from
distinguished men of his time.&nbsp; Among those few were several
from Edward FitzGerald, whose character contrasted so strangely
with that of the tempestuous Borrow.&nbsp; In 1856 FitzGerald
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">31 <span
class="smcap">Great Portland Street</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">London</span>, 27<i>th</i> <i>October</i>
1856.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is I who send
you the new Turkish Dictionary [Redhouse&rsquo;s Turkish &amp;
English Dictionary] which ought to go by this Post; my reasons
being that I bought it really only for the purpose of doing that
little good to the spirited Publisher of the book (who thought
when he began it that the [Crimean] War was to last), and I send
it to you because I should be glad of your opinion, if you can
give it.&nbsp; I am afraid that you will hardly condescend to
<i>use</i> it, for you abide in the old Meninsky; but if you
<i>will</i> use it, I shall be very glad.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think <i>I</i> ever shall; and so what is to be done with it now
it is bought?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Kerrich told you of my being too
<i>lazy</i> to go over to Yarmouth to see you a year ago.&nbsp;
No such thing as that.&nbsp; I simply had doubts as to whether
you would not rather remain unlookt for.&nbsp; I know I enjoyed
my evening with you a month ago.&nbsp; I wanted to ask you to
read some of the <i>Northern Ballads</i> too; but you shut the
book.</p>
<p>I must tell you.&nbsp; I am come up here on my way to
Chichester to be married! to Miss Barton (of Quaker memory) and
our united ages amount to 96!&mdash;a dangerous experiment on
both sides.&nbsp; She at least brings a fine head and heart to
the bargain&mdash;worthy of a better market.&nbsp; But it is to
be, and I dare say you will honestly wish we may do well.</p>
<p>Keep the book as long as you will.&nbsp; It is useless to
me.&nbsp; I shall be to be heard of through Geldeston Hall,
Beccles.&nbsp; With compliments to Mrs Borrow, believe me,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Edward
FitzGerald</span>.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Donne is well, and wants to know about
you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few months later FitzGerald wrote again:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;Will you send me

misquoting him in a way that will make [Professor] E. Cowell [of
Cambridge] answerable for another&rsquo;s blunder, which must not
be.&nbsp; You shall have &rsquo;<i>Omar</i> back directly, or
whenever you want him, and I should really like to make you a
copy (taking my time) of the best Quatrains.&nbsp; I am now
looking over the Calcutta MS. which has 500!&mdash;very many
quite as good as those in the MS. you have; but very many in
<i>both</i> MSS. are well omitted.</p>
<p>I have been for a fortnight to Geldeston where Kerrich is not
very well.&nbsp; I shall look for you one day in my Yarmouth
rounds, and you know how entirely disengaged and glad to see you
I am here.&nbsp; I have two fresh Nieces with me&mdash;and I find
I gave you the <i>worst</i> wine of two samples Diver sent
me.&nbsp; I wish you would send word by bearer you are
better&mdash;this one word written will be enough you see.</p>
<p>My old Parson Crabbe is bowing down under epileptic fits, or
something like, and I believe his brave old white head will soon

truly,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What effect the sweet gentleness of FitzGerald&rsquo;s nature
had upon that of Borrow is not known, for the replies have not
been preserved.&nbsp; FitzGerald was a man capable of soothing
the angriest and most discontented mind, and it is a misfortune
that he saw so little of Borrow.&nbsp; In the early part of the
following year (24th Jan. 1857) FitzGerald wrote to Professor E.
B. Cowell of Cambridge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was with Borrow a week ago at
Donne&rsquo;s, and also at Yarmouth three months ago: he is well,
but not yet agreed with Murray.&nbsp; He read me a long
Translation he had made from the Turkish: which I could not
admire, and his Taste becomes stranger than ever.&rdquo; <a
name="citation428a"></a><a href="#footnote428a"
class="citation">[428a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Wales Mrs George Borrow had written (Sept. 1854) to old
Mrs Borrow: &ldquo;He [Borrow] will, I expect at Christmas,
publish his other work [<i>The Romany Rye</i>] together with his
poetry in all the European languages.&rdquo; <a
name="citation428b"></a><a href="#footnote428b"
class="citation">[428b]</a>&nbsp; In November (1854) the
manuscript of <i>The Romany Rye</i> was delivered to John Murray,
who appears to have taken his time in reading it; for it was not
until 23rd December that he expressed his views in the following
letter.&nbsp; Even when the letter was written it was allowed to
remain in John Murray&rsquo;s desk for five weeks, not being sent
until 27th January:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;I
have read with care the MS. of <i>The Romany Rye</i> and have
pondered anxiously over it; and in what I am about to write I
think I may fairly claim the privilege of a friend deeply
interested in you personally, as well as in your reputation as
author, and by no means insensible to the abilities displayed in
your various works.&nbsp; It is my firm conviction then, that you
will incur the certainty of failure and run the risque of
injuring your literary fame by publishing the MS. as it
stands.&nbsp; Very large omissions seem to me&mdash;and in this,
Elwin, <a name="citation429"></a><a href="#footnote429"
class="citation">[429]</a> no mean judge,
concurs&mdash;absolutely indispensable.&nbsp; That
<i>Lavengro</i> would have profited by curtailment, I stated
before its publication.&nbsp; The result has verified my
anticipations, and in the present instance I feel compelled to
make it the condition of publication.&nbsp; You can well imagine
that it is not my <i>interest</i> to shorten a book from two
volumes to one unless there were really good cause.</p>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> clearly has not been successful.&nbsp; Let us
not then risque the chance of another failure, but try to avoid
the rock upon which we then split.&nbsp; You have so great store
of interesting matter in your mind and in your notes, that I
cannot but feel it to be a pity that you should harp always upon
one string, as it were.&nbsp; It seems to me that you have dwelt
too long on English ground in this new work, and have
resuscitated some characters of the former book (such as F.
Ardry) whom your readers would have been better pleased to have
left behind.&nbsp; Why should you not introduce us rather to
those novel scenes of Moscovite and Hungarian life respecting
which I have heard you drop so many stimulating allusions.&nbsp;
Do not, I pray, take offence at what I have written.&nbsp; It is
difficult and even painful for me to assume the office of critic,
and this is one of the reasons why this note has lingered so long
in my desk.&nbsp; Fortunately, in the advice I am tendering I am
supported by others of better literary judgment than myself, and
who have also deep regard for you.&nbsp; I will specify below
some of the passages which I would point out for
omission.&mdash;With best remembrances, I remain, my dear Borrow,
Your faithful publisher and sincere friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">John
Murray</span>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On 29th January, Mrs Borrow wrote to John Murray a letter that
was inspired by Borrow himself.&nbsp; Dr Knapp discovered the
original draft, some of which was in Borrow&rsquo;s own
hand.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr
Murray</span>,&mdash;We have received your letters.&nbsp; In the
first place I beg leave to say something on a very principal
point.&nbsp; You talk about <i>conditions</i> of
publishing.&nbsp; Mr Borrow has not the slightest wish to publish
the book.&nbsp; The MS. was left with you because you wished to
see it, and when left, you were particularly requested not to let
it pass out of your own hands.&nbsp; But it seems you have shown
it to various individuals whose opinions you repeat.&nbsp; What
those opinions are worth may be gathered from the following
fact.</p>
<p>The book is one of the most learned works ever written; yet in
the summary of the opinions which you give, not one single
allusion is made to the learning which pervades the book, no more
than if it contained none at all.&nbsp; It is treated just as if
all the philological and historical facts were mere inventions,
and the book a common novel . . .</p>
<p>With regard to <i>Lavengro</i> it is necessary to observe that
if ever a book experienced infamous and undeserved treatment it
was that book.&nbsp; It was attacked in every form that envy and
malice could suggest, on account of Mr Borrow&rsquo;s
acquirements and the success of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, and it
was deserted by those whose duty it was, in some degree to have
protected it.&nbsp; No attempt was ever made to refute the vile
calumny that it was a book got up against the Popish agitation of
&rsquo;51.&nbsp; It was written years previous to that
period&mdash;a fact of which none is better aware than the
Publisher.&nbsp; Is that calumny to be still permitted to go
unanswered?</p>
<p>If these suggestions are attended to, well and good; if not,
Mr Borrow can bide his time.&nbsp; He is independent of the
public and of everybody.&nbsp; Say no more on that Russian
Subject.&nbsp; Mr Borrow has had quite enough of the press.&nbsp;
If he wrote a book on Russia, it would be said to be like <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, or it would be said to be unlike <i>The Bible
in Spain</i>, and would be blamed in either case.&nbsp; He has
written a book in connection with England such as no other body
could have written, and he now rests from his labours.&nbsp; He
has found England an ungrateful country.&nbsp; It owes much to
him, and he owes nothing to it.&nbsp; If he had been a low
ignorant impostor, like a person he could name, he would have
been employed and honoured.&mdash;I remain, Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mary
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 5th April 1856 Mrs Borrow wrote again, requesting Murray to
return the manuscript, but for what purpose she does not
state.&nbsp; Two days later it was despatched by rail from
Albemarle Street.</p>
<p>Some years before, Borrow had met Rev. Whitwell Elwin, Rector
of Booton, somewhere about the time he (Elwin) came up to London
to edit <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, viz., 1853. <a
name="citation431"></a><a href="#footnote431"
class="citation">[431]</a>&nbsp; The first interview between the
two men has been described as characteristic of both.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Borrow was just then very sore with his
slashing critics, and on someone mentioning that Elwin was a
&lsquo;<i>Quartering</i> reviewer,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Sir, I
wish you a better employment.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then hastily changing
the subject, he called out, &lsquo;What party are you in the
Church&mdash;Tractarian, Moderate, or Evangelical?&nbsp; I am
happy to say, <i>I</i> am the old <i>High</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am happy to say I am <i>not</i>,&rsquo; was
Elwin&rsquo;s emphatic reply.&nbsp; Borrow boasted of his
proficiency in the Norfolk dialect, which he endeavoured to speak
as broadly as possible.&nbsp; &lsquo;I told him,&rsquo; said
Elwin, &lsquo;that he had not cultivated it with his usual
success.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the conversation proceeded it became
less disputatious, and the two ended by becoming so cordial that
they promised to visit each other.&nbsp; Borrow fulfilled his
promise in the following October, when he went to Booton, and was
&lsquo;full of anecdote and reminiscence,&rsquo; and delighted
the rectory children by singing them songs in the gypsy
tongue.&nbsp; Elwin during this visit urged him to try his hand
at an article for the Review.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I have made a resolution never to have anything to do with
such a blackguard trade.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation432a"></a><a href="#footnote432a"
class="citation">[432a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elwin became greatly interested in <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; He endeavoured to influence its composition, and
even wrote to Borrow begging him &ldquo;to give his sequel to
<i>Lavengro</i> more of an historical, and less of a romancing
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not happy about the book.&nbsp; He wrote
to John Murray in March:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not the statements themselves
which provoke incredulity, but the melodramatic effect which he
tries to impart to all his adventures.&rsquo;&nbsp; Instead of
&lsquo;roaring like a lion,&rsquo; in reply, as Elwin had
expected, he returned quite a &lsquo;lamb-like&rsquo; note, which
gave promise of a greater success for his new work than its
precursor.&rdquo; <a name="citation432b"></a><a
href="#footnote432b" class="citation">[432b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow appears to have become tired of biding his time with
regard to <i>The Romany Rye</i>, and on 27th Feb. 1857 he wrote
to John Murray to say that &ldquo;the work must go to press, and
that unless the printing is forthwith commenced, I must come up
to London and make arrangements myself.&nbsp; Time is passing
away.&nbsp; It ought to have appeared many years ago.&nbsp; I can
submit to no more delays.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work was accordingly
proceeded with, and Elwin wrote a criticism of the work for
<i>The Quarterly Review</i> from the proof-sheets:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the review was almost finished, it was
on the point of being altogether withdrawn, owing to a passage in
<i>Romany Rye</i> which Elwin said was clearly meant to be a
reflection on his friend Ford, &lsquo;to avenge the presumed
refusal of the latter to praise <i>Lavengro</i> in <i>The
Quarterly Review</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am very
anxious,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to get Borrow justice for rare
merits which have been entirely overlooked, but if he persists in
publishing an attack of this kind I shall, I fear, not be able to
serve him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The objectionable paragraphs had been
written by Borrow under a misapprehension, and he cancelled them
as soon as he was convinced of his error.&rdquo; <a
name="citation433"></a><a href="#footnote433"
class="citation">[433]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Murray determined not to publish the book unless the
offending passage were removed.&nbsp; He wrote to Borrow the
following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">8<i>th</i> <i>April</i>
1857.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;When I have
done anything towards you deserving of apology I will not
hesitate to offer one.&nbsp; As it is, I have acted loyally
towards you, and with a view to maintain your interests.</p>
<p>I agreed to publish your present work solely with the object
of obliging you, and in a great degree at the strong
recommendation of Cooke.&nbsp; I meant (as was my duty) to do my
very best to promote its success.&nbsp; You on your side promised
to listen to me in regard to any necessary omissions; and on the
faith of this, I pointed out one omission, which I make the
indispensable condition of my proceeding further with the
book.&nbsp; I have asked nothing unfair nor
unreasonable&mdash;nay, a compliance with the request is
essential for your own character as an author and a man.</p>
<p>You are the last man that I should ever expect to
&ldquo;frighten or bully&rdquo;; and if a mild but firm
remonstrance against an offensive passage in your book is
interpreted by you into such an application, I submit that the
grounds for the notion must exist nowhere but in your own
imagination.&nbsp; The alternative offered to you is to omit or
publish elsewhere.&nbsp; Nothing shall compel me to publish what
you have written.&nbsp; Think calmly and dispassionately over
this, and when you have decided let me know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">John
Murray</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference that had so offended Murray and Elwin had, in
all probability been interpolated in proof form, otherwise it
would have been discovered either when Murray read the manuscript
or Elwin the proofs.&nbsp; By return of post came the following
reply from Borrow, then at Great Yarmouth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;Yesterday I received your letter.&nbsp; You had
better ask your cousin [Robert Cooke] to come down and talk about
matters.&nbsp; <i>After</i> Monday I shall be disengaged and
shall be most happy to see him.&nbsp; And now I must tell you
that you are exceedingly injudicious.&nbsp; You call a chapter
heavy, and I, not wishing to appear unaccommodating, remove or
alter two or three passages for which I do not particularly care,
whereupon you make most unnecessary comments, obtruding your
private judgment upon matters with which you have no business,
and of which it is impossible that you should have a competent
knowledge.&nbsp; If you disliked the passages you might have said
so, but you had no right to say anything more.&nbsp; I believe
that you not only meant no harm, but that your intentions were
good; unfortunately, however, people with the best of intentions
occasionally do a great deal of harm.&nbsp; In your language you
are frequently in the highest degree injudicious; for example, in
your last letter you talk of obliging me by publishing my
work.&nbsp; Now is not that speaking very injudiciously?&nbsp;
Surely you forget that I could return a most cutting answer were
I disposed to do so.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that your intentions are good, and that
you are disposed to be friendly.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tone of this letter is strangely reminiscent of some of
the Rev Andrew Brandram&rsquo;s admonitions to Borrow himself,
during his association with the Bible Society.&nbsp; Borrow bowed
to the wind, and the offending passage was deleted, and <i>The
Romany Rye</i> eventually appeared on 30th April 1857, in an
edition of a thousand copies.&nbsp; The public, or such part of
it as had not forgotten Borrow, had been kept waiting six years
to know what had happened on the morning after the storm.&nbsp;
<i>Lavengro</i> had ended by the postilion concluding his story
with &ldquo;Young gentleman, I will now take a spell on your
blanket&mdash;young lady, good-night,&rdquo; and presumably the
three, Borrow, Isopel Berners and their guest had lain down to
sleep, and a great quiet fell upon the dingle, and the moon and
the stars shone down upon it, and the red glow from the charcoal
in the brazier paled and died away.</p>
<p><i>The Romany Rye</i> is a puzzling book.&nbsp; The latter
portion, at least, seems to suggest &ldquo;spiritual
autobiography.&rdquo;&nbsp; It reveals the man, his atmosphere,
his character, and nowhere better than among the jockeys at
Horncastle.&nbsp; It gives a better and more convincing picture
of Borrow than the most accurate list of dates and occurrences,
all vouched for upon unimpeachable authority.&nbsp; It is
impressionism applied to autobiography, which has always been
considered as essentially a subject for photographic
treatment.&nbsp; Borrow thought otherwise, with the result that
many people decline to believe that his picture is a portrait,
because there is a question as to the dates.</p>
<p>Among the reviews, which were on the whole unfriendly, was the
remarkable notice in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, by the Rev.
Whitwell Elwin:&mdash;<a name="citation435"></a><a
href="#footnote435" class="citation">[435]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;sympathises
with wounded vanity, and the world only laughs when a man angrily
informs it that it does not rate him at his true value.&nbsp; The
public to whom he appeals must, after all, be the judge of his
pretensions.&nbsp; Their verdict at first is frequently wrong,
but it is they themselves who must reverse it, and not the author
who is upon his trial before them.&nbsp; The attacks of critics,
if they are unjust, invariably yield to the same remedy.&nbsp;
Though we do not think that Mr Borrow is a good counsel in his
own cause, we are yet strongly of the opinion that Time in this
case has some wrongs to repair, and that <i>Lavengro</i> has
<i>not</i> obtained the fame which was its due.&nbsp; It contains
passages which in their way are not surpassed by anything in
English Literature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The value of these prophetic words lies in the fine spirit of
fatherly reproof in which the whole review was written.&nbsp; It
is the work of a critic who regarded literature as a thing to be
approached, both by author and reviewer, with grave and
deliberate ceremony, not with enthusiasm or prejudice.&nbsp; From
any other source the following words would not have possessed the
significance they did, coming from a man of such sane ideas with
the courage to express them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Various portions of the history are known
to be a faithful narrative of Mr Borrow&rsquo;s career, while we
ourselves can testify, as to many other parts of his volumes,
that nothing can excel the fidelity with which he has described
both men and things.&nbsp; Far from his showing any tendency to
exaggeration, such of his characters as we chance to have known,
and they are not a few, are rather within the truth than beyond
it.&nbsp; However picturesquely they may be drawn, the lines are
invariably those of nature.&nbsp; Why under these circumstances
he should envelop the question in mystery is more than we can
divine.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the larger part, and
possibly the whole, of the work is a narrative of actual
occurrences.&rdquo; <a name="citation436"></a><a
href="#footnote436" class="citation">[436]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Appendix itself, which had drawn from Elwin the grave
declaration that &ldquo;Mr Borrow is very angry with his
critics,&rdquo; is a fine piece of rhetorical denunciation.&nbsp;
It opens with the deliberate restraint of a man who feels the
fury of his wrath surging up within him.&nbsp; It tells again the
story of <i>Lavengro</i>, pointing morals as it goes.&nbsp; Then
the studied calm is lost&mdash;Priestcraft, &ldquo;Foreign
Nonsense,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gentility Nonsense,&rdquo; &ldquo;Canting
Nonsense,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pseudo-Critics,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pseudo-Radicals&rdquo; he flogs and pillories mercilessly
until, arriving at &ldquo;The Old Radical,&rdquo; he throws off
all restraint and lunges out wildly, mad with hate and
despair.&nbsp; As a piece of literary folly, the Appendix to
<i>The Romany Rye</i> has probably never been surpassed.&nbsp; It
alienated from Borrow all but his personal friends, and it sealed
his literary fate as far as his own generation was
concerned.&nbsp; In short, he had burnt his boats.</p>
<p>Borrow had sent a copy of <i>The Romany Rye</i> to FitzGerald,
which is referred to by him in a letter written from Gorleston to
Professor Cowell (5th June 1857):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Within hail almost lives George Borrow who
has lately published, and given me, two new Volumes of Lavengro
called <i>Romany Rye</i>, with some excellent things, and some
very bad (as I have made bold to write to him&mdash;how shall I
face him!).&nbsp; You would not like the Book at all, I
think.&rdquo; <a name="citation437a"></a><a href="#footnote437a"
class="citation">[437a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was bitterly disappointed at the effect produced by
<i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; On someone once saying that it was
the finest piece of literary invective since Swift, he replied,
&ldquo;Yes, I meant it to be; and what do you think the effect
was?&nbsp; No one took the least notice of it!&rdquo; <a
name="citation437b"></a><a href="#footnote437b"
class="citation">[437b]</a></p>
<p><i>The Romany Rye</i> was not a success.&nbsp; The thousand
copies lasted a year.&nbsp; When it appeared likely that a second
edition would be required, Borrow wrote to John Murray urging him
not to send the book to the press again until he &ldquo;was quite
sure the demand for it will at least defray all attendant
expenses.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw that whatever profits had resulted
from the publication of the first edition, were in danger of
being swallowed up in the preparation of a second.&nbsp; When
this did eventually make its appearance in 1858, it was limited
to 750 copies, which lasted until 1872.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s own attitude with regard to the work and his
wisdom in publishing it is summed up in a letter to John Murray
(17th Sept. 1857):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was very anxious to bring it out,&rdquo;
he writes; &ldquo;and I bless God that I had the courage and
perseverance to do so.&nbsp; It is of course unpalatable to many;
for it scorns to foster delusion, to cry &lsquo;peace where there
is no peace,&rsquo; and denounces boldly the evils which are
hurrying the country to destruction, and which have kindled
God&rsquo;s anger against it, namely, the pride, insolence,
cruelty, covetousness, and hypocrisy of its people, and above all
the rage for gentility, which must be indulged in at the expense
of every good and honourable feeling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writing of the Appendix had aroused in Borrow all his old
enthusiasm, and he appears to have come to the determination to
publish a number of works, including a veritable library of
translations.&nbsp; At the end of <i>The Romany Rye</i> appeared
a lengthy list of books in preparation. <a
name="citation438"></a><a href="#footnote438"
class="citation">[438]</a></p>
<p>In August 1857 Borrow paid a second visit to Wales, walking
&ldquo;upwards of four hundred miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Starting from
Laugharne in Carmarthenshire, he visited Tenby, Pembroke, Milford
Haven, Haverford, St David&rsquo;s, Fishguard, Newport, Cardigan,
Lampeter; passing into Brecknockshire, he eventually reached
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross in Hereford and thence to
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In October he was at Leighton, Donnington and
Uppington, where he found traces of Gronwy Owen, the one-time
curate and all-time poet.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Borrow had shown by every action and word
written about her, the great love he bore his mother.&nbsp; When
his wife wrote to her and he was too restless to do so himself,
he would interpolate two or three lines to &ldquo;My dear
Mamma.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was always in his thoughts, and he never
wavered in his love for her and devotion to her comfort; whilst
she looked upon him as only a mother so good and so tender could
look upon a son who had become her &ldquo;only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many years of her life it had been ordained that this
brave old lady should live alone. <a name="citation439"></a><a
href="#footnote439" class="citation">[439]</a>&nbsp; In the
middle of August 1858 the news reached Borrow that his mother had
been taken suddenly ill.&nbsp; She was in her eighty-seventh
year, and at such an age all illnesses are dangerous.&nbsp;
Borrow hastened to Oulton, and arrived just in time to be with
her at the last.</p>
<p>Thus on 16th August 1858, of &ldquo;pulmonary
congestion,&rdquo; died Anne Borrow, who had followed her husband
about with his regiment, and had reared and educated her two boys
under circumstances of great disadvantage.&nbsp; She had lost
one; but the other, her youngest born, whom she had so often
shielded from his father&rsquo;s reproaches, had been spared to
her, and she had seen him famous.&nbsp; Upon her grave in Oulton
Churchyard the son caused to be inscribed the words, &ldquo;She
was a good wife and a good mother,&rdquo; than which no woman can
ask more. <a name="citation440a"></a><a href="#footnote440a"
class="citation">[440a]</a></p>
<p>The death of his mother was a great shock to Borrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He felt the blow keenly,&rdquo; Mrs Borrow wrote to John
Murray, &ldquo;and I advised a tour in Scotland to recruit his
health and spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly he went North early
in October, leaving his wife and Henrietta at Great
Yarmouth.&nbsp; He visited the Highlands, walking several hundred
miles.&nbsp; Mull struck him as &ldquo;a very wild country,
perhaps the wildest in Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of its
place-names reminded him strongly of the Isle of Man.&nbsp; At
the end of November he finished up the tour at Lerwick in
Shetland, where he bought presents for his &ldquo;loved
ones,&rdquo; having seen Greenock, Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen,
Inverness, Wick, Thurso among other places.&nbsp; His impressions
were not altogether favourable to the Scotch.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
queerer country I never saw in all my life,&rdquo; he wrote later
. . . &ldquo;a queerer set of people than the Scotch you would
scarcely see in a summer&rsquo;s day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation440b"></a><a href="#footnote440b"
class="citation">[440b]</a></p>
<p>In the following year (1859) an excursion was made to Ireland
by Borrow and his family.&nbsp; Making Dublin his headquarters,
where he left his wife and Henrietta comfortably settled, he
tramped to Connemara and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, the
expedition being full of adventure and affording him &ldquo;much
pleasure,&rdquo; in spite of the fact that he was
&ldquo;frequently wet to the skin, and indifferently
lodged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had inherited from his mother some property at
Mattishall Burgh, one and a half miles from his birth-place,
consisting of some land, a thatched house and outbuildings, now
demolished.&nbsp; This was let to a small-holder named Henry
Hill.&nbsp; Borrow thought very highly of his tenant, and for
hours together would tramp up and down beside him as he ploughed
the land, asking questions, and hearing always something new from
the amazing stores of nature knowledge that Henry Hill had
acquired.&nbsp; This Norfolk worthy appears to have been
possessed of a genius for many things.&nbsp; He was well versed
in herbal lore, a self-taught &rsquo;cellist, playing each Sunday
in the Congregational Chapel at Mattishall, and an equally
self-taught watch-repairer; but his chief claim to fame was as a
bee-keeper, local tradition crediting him with being the first
man to keep bees under glass.&nbsp; He would solemnly state that
his bees, whom he looked upon as friends, talked to him.&nbsp; On
Sundays the country folk for miles round would walk over to
Mattishall Burgh to see old Henry Hill&rsquo;s bees, and hear him
expound their lore.&nbsp; It was perforce Sunday, there was no
other day for the Norfolk farm-labourer of that generation, who
seemed always to live on the verge of starvation.&nbsp; Borrow
himself expressed regret to Henry Hill that it had not been
possible to add the education of the academy to that of the
land.&nbsp; He saw that the combination would have produced an
even more remarkable man.</p>
<p>In Norfolk all strangers are regarded with suspicion.&nbsp;
Lifelong friendships are not contracted in a day.&nbsp; The East
Anglian is shrewd, and requires to know something about those
whom he admits to the sacred inner circle of his
friendship.&nbsp; Borrow was well-known in the Mattishall
district, and was looked upon with more than usual
suspicion.&nbsp; He was unquestionably a strange man, in speech,
in appearance, in habits.&nbsp; He could and would knock down any
who offended him; but, worst of all, he was the intimate of
gypsies, sat by their fires, spoke in their tongue.&nbsp; The
population round about was entirely an agricultural one, and all
united in hating the gypsies as their greatest enemies, because
of their depredations.&nbsp; Add to this the fact that Borrow was
a frequenter of public-houses, of which there were <i>seven</i>
in the village, and was wont to boast that you could get at the
true man only after he had been mellowed into speech by good
English ale.&nbsp; Then he would open his heart and unburden his
mind of all the accumulated knowledge that he possessed, and add
something to the epic of the soil.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
overbearing manner made people shy of him.&nbsp; On one occasion
he told John, the son and successor of Henry Hill, that he ought
to be responsible for the debt of his half-brother; the debt, it
may be mentioned, was to Borrow.</p>
<p>There is no better illustration of the suspicion with which
Borrow was regarded locally, than an incident that occurred
during one of his visits to Mattishall.&nbsp; He called upon John
Hill at Church Farm to collect his rent.&nbsp; The evening was
spent very agreeably.&nbsp; Borrow recited some of his ballads,
quoted Scripture and languages, and sang a song.&nbsp; He was
particularly interested on account of Mrs Hill being from London,
where she knew many of his haunts.&nbsp; He remained the whole
evening with the family and partook of their meal; but was
allowed to go to one of the seven public-houses for a bed,
although there were spare bedrooms in the house that he might
have occupied.&nbsp; Such was the suspicion that Borrow&rsquo;s
habits created in the minds of his fellow East Anglians. <a

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
JULY 1859&ndash;JANUARY 1869</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his second tour in Wales,
Borrow had submitted to John Murray the manuscript of his
translation of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i>, which in 1830 had so
alarmed the little Welsh bookseller of Smithfield.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
really want something to do,&rdquo; Borrow wrote, &ldquo;and
seeing the work passing through the press might amuse
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Murray, however, could not see his way to accept
the offer, and the manuscript was returned.&nbsp; Borrow decided
to publish the book at his own expense, and accordingly
commissioned a Yarmouth man to print him 250 copies, upon the
title-page of which John Murray permitted his name to appear.</p>
<p>In the note in which he tells of the Welsh bookseller&rsquo;s
doubts and fears, Borrow goes on to assure his readers that there
is no harm in the book.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that the
Author is any thing but mincing in his expressions and
descriptions, but there is nothing in the Sleeping Bard which can
give offence to any but the over fastidious.&nbsp; There is a
great deal of squeamish nonsense in the world; let us hope
however that there is not so much as there was.&nbsp; Indeed can
we doubt that such folly is on the decline, when we find
Albemarle Street in &rsquo;60, willing to publish a harmless but
plain speaking book which Smithfield shrank from in
&rsquo;30.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The edition was very speedily exhausted, largely on account of
an article entitled, <i>The Welsh and Their Literature</i>,
written years before, that Borrow adapted as a review of the
book, and published anonymously in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>
(Jan. 1861).&nbsp; <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> was not
reprinted.</p>
<p>The next event of importance in Borrow&rsquo;s life was his
removal to London with Mrs Borrow and Henrietta.&nbsp; Towards
the end of the Irish holiday (4th Nov. 1859), Mrs Borrow had
written to John Murray: &ldquo;If all be well in the Spring, I
shall wish to look around, and select a pleasant, healthy
residence within from three to ten miles of London.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow may have felt more at liberty to make the change now that
his mother was dead, although whilst she was at Oulton he was as
little company for her at Great Yarmouth as he would have been in
London.&nbsp; Whatever led them to the decision to take up their
residence in London, Borrow and his wife left Great Yarmouth at
the end of June, and immediately proceeded to look about them for
a suitable house.&nbsp; Their choice eventually fell upon number
22 Hereford Square, Brompton, which had the misfortune to be only
a few doors from number 26, where lived Frances Power
Cobbe.&nbsp; The rent was &pound;65 per annum.&nbsp; The Borrows
entered upon their tenancy at the Michaelmas quarter, and were
joined by Henrietta, who had remained behind at Great Yarmouth
during the house-hunting.</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe has given in her Autobiography a very unlovely
picture of George Borrow during the period of his residence in
Hereford Square.&nbsp; No woman, except his relatives and
dependants, will tolerate egoism in a man.&nbsp; Borrow was an
egoist.&nbsp; If not permitted to lead the conversation, he
frequently wrapped himself in a gloomy silence and waited for an
opportunity to discomfit the usurper of the place he seemed to
consider his own.&nbsp; Among his papers were found after his
death a large number of letters from poor men whom Borrow had
assisted.&nbsp; His friend the Rev. Francis Cunningham once wrote
to him a letter protesting against his assisting Nonconformist
schools.&nbsp; He gave to Church and Chapel alike.&nbsp; This
disproves misanthropy, and leaves egoism as the only explanation
of his occasional lapses into bitterness or rudeness.&nbsp; When
in happy vein, however, &ldquo;his conversation . . . was unlike
that of any other man; whether he told a long story or only
commented on some ordinary topic, he was always quaint, often
humorous.&rdquo; <a name="citation445a"></a><a
href="#footnote445a" class="citation">[445a]</a></p>
<p>Miss Cobbe would not humour an egoist, because
constitutionally women, especially clever women, dislike them,
unless they wish to marry them.&nbsp; When she heard it said, as
it very frequently was said, that Borrow was a gypsy by blood,
she caustically remarked that if he were not he
&ldquo;<i>ought</i> to have been.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Cobbe had
living with her a Miss Lloyd who, &ldquo;amused by his quaint
stories and his (real or sham) enthusiasm for Wales, . . .
cultivated his acquaintance.&nbsp; I,&rdquo; continued Miss Cobbe
frankly, &ldquo;never liked him, thinking him more or less of a
hypocrite.&rdquo; <a name="citation445b"></a><a
href="#footnote445b" class="citation">[445b]</a></p>
<p>On one occasion Borrow had accepted an invitation from Miss
Cobbe to meet some friends, but subsequently withdrew his
acceptance &ldquo;on finding that Dr Martineau was to be of the
party . . . nor did he ever after attend our little assemblies
without first ascertaining that Dr Martineau would not be
present!&rdquo;&nbsp; This she explained by the assertion that Dr
Martineau had &ldquo;horsed&rdquo; Borrow when he was punished
for running away from school at Norwich.&nbsp; It appeared
&ldquo;irresistibly comic&rdquo; to her mind.</p>
<p>There is an amusing account given by Miss Cobbe of how she
worsted Borrow, which is certainly extremely flattering to her
accomplishments.&nbsp; Once when talking with him she happened to
say</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;something about the imperfect education of
women, and he said it was <i>right</i> they should be ignorant,
and that no man could endure a clever wife.&nbsp; I laughed at
him openly,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;and told him some men
knew better.&nbsp; What did he think of the Brownings?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, he had heard the name; he did not know anything of
them.&nbsp; Since Scott, he read no modern writer; Scott <i>was
greater than Homer</i>!&nbsp; What he liked were curious, old,
erudite books about medi&aelig;val and northern
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said I knew little of such literature, and
preferred the writers of our own age, but indeed I was no great
student at all.&nbsp; Thereupon he evidently wanted to astonish
me; and, talking of Ireland, said, &lsquo;Ah, yes; a most
curious, mixed race.&nbsp; First there were the
Firbolgs,&mdash;the old enchanters, who raised
mists.&rsquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Mr
Borrow,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;it was the Tuatha-de-Danaan who
did that?&nbsp; Keatinge expressly says that they conquered the
Firbolgs by that means.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Mr B. somewhat out of
countenance), &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; Keatinge is <i>the</i>
authority; a most extraordinary writer.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
I should call him the Geoffrey of Monmouth of
Ireland.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Mr B. changing the <i>venue</i>), &lsquo;I
delight in Norse-stories; they are far grander than the
Greek.&nbsp; There is the story of Olaf the Saint of
Norway.&nbsp; Can anything be grander?&nbsp; What a noble
character!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what do
<i>you</i> think of his putting all those poor Druids on the
Skerry of Shrieks, and leaving them to be drowned by the
tide?&rsquo;&nbsp; (Thereupon Mr B. looked at me askant out of
his gipsy eyes, as if he thought me an example of the evils of
female education!)&nbsp; &lsquo;Well!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I forgot
about the Skerry of Shrieks.&nbsp; Then there is the story of
Beowulf the Saxon going out to sea in his burning ship to
die.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Mr Borrow! that isn&rsquo;t a Saxon
story at all.&nbsp; It is in the Heimskringla!&nbsp; It is told
of Hakon of Norway.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, I asked him about the
gipsies and their language, and if they were certainly
Aryans?&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know (or pretended not to know)
what Aryans were; and altogether displayed a miraculous mixture
of odd knowledge and more odd ignorance.&nbsp; Whether the latter
were real or assumed I know not!&rdquo; <a
name="citation446"></a><a href="#footnote446"
class="citation">[446]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the neighbourly little pleasantries
indulged in by Miss Cobbe, regarding a man who was a frequent
guest at her house.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His has indeed been a fantastic
fate!&rdquo; writes Mr Theodore Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
the shortcomings of any illustrious man save Borrow are under
discussion, &lsquo;<i>les d&eacute;fauts de ses
qualit&eacute;s</i>&rsquo; is the criticism&mdash;wise as
charitable&mdash;which they evoke.&nbsp; Yes, each one is allowed
to have his angularities save Borrow.&nbsp; Each one is allowed
to show his own pet unpleasant facets of character now and
then&mdash;allowed to show them as inevitable foils to the
pleasant ones&mdash;save Borrow.&nbsp; <i>His</i> weaknesses no
one ever condones.&nbsp; During his lifetime his faults were for
ever chafing and irritating his acquaintances, and now that he
and they are dead, these faults of his seem to be chafing and
irritating people of another generation.&nbsp; A fantastic fate,
I say, for him who was so interesting to some of us!&rdquo; <a
name="citation447a"></a><a href="#footnote447a"
class="citation">[447a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On occasion Borrow could be inexcusably rude, as he was to a
member of the Russian Embassy who one day called at Hereford
Square for a copy of <i>Targum</i> for the Czar, when he told him
that his Imperial master could fetch it himself.&nbsp; Again, no
one can defend him for affronting the &ldquo;very distinguished
scholar&rdquo; with whom he happened to disagree, by thundering
out, &ldquo;Sir, you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such lapses
are deplorable; but why should we view them in a different light
from those of Dr Johnson?</p>
<p>What would have been regarded in another distinguished man as
a pleasant vein of humour was in Borrow&rsquo;s case looked upon
as evidence of his unveracity.&nbsp; A contemporary tells how, on
one occasion, he went with him into &ldquo;a tavern&rdquo; for a
pint of ale, when Borrow pointed out</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;a yokel at the far end of the
apartment.&nbsp; The foolish bumpkin was slumbering.&nbsp; Borrow
in a stage whisper, gravely assured me that the man was a
murderer, and confided to me with all the emphasis of honest
conviction the scene and details of his crime.&nbsp; Subsequently
I ascertained that the elaborate incidents and fine touches of
local colour were but the coruscations of a too vivid
imagination, and that the villain of the ale-house on the common
was as innocent as the author of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation447b"></a><a href="#footnote447b"
class="citation">[447b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Borrow had been called upon to explain this little
pleasantry he would in all probability have replied in the words
of Mr Petulengro, that he had told his acquaintance &ldquo;things
. . . which are not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is strange how those among his contemporaries who disliked
him, denied Borrow the indulgence that is almost invariably
accorded to genius.&nbsp; Those who were not for him were
bitterly against him.&nbsp; In their eyes he was either
outrageously uncivil or insultingly rude.&nbsp; Dr Hake, although
a close friend, saw Borrow&rsquo;s dominant weakness, his love of
the outward evidences of fame.&nbsp; Dr Hake&rsquo;s impartiality
gives greater weight to his testimony when he tells of
Borrow&rsquo;s first meeting with Dr Robert Latham, the
ethnologist, philologist and grammarian.&nbsp; Latham much wanted
to meet Borrow, and promised Dr Hake to be on his best
behaviour.&nbsp; He was accordingly invited to dinner with
Borrow.&nbsp; Latham as usual began to show off his
knowledge.&nbsp; He became aggressive, and finally very excited;
but throughout the meal Borrow showed the utmost patience and
courtesy, much to his host&rsquo;s relief.&nbsp; When he
subsequently encountered Latham in the street he always stopped
&ldquo;to say a kind word, seeing his forlorn
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Hake had settled at Coombe End, Roehampton, and now that
the Borrows were in London, the two families renewed their old
friendship.&nbsp; Borrow would walk over to Coombe End, and on
arriving at the gate would call out, &ldquo;Are you
alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; If there were other callers he would pass by,
if not he would enter and frequently persuade Dr Hake, and
perhaps his sons, to accompany him for a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something not easily forgotten,&rdquo; writes
Mr A. Egmont Hake, &ldquo;in the manner in which he would
unexpectedly come to our gates, singing some gypsy song, and as
suddenly depart.&rdquo; <a name="citation448"></a><a
href="#footnote448" class="citation">[448]</a>&nbsp; They had
many pleasant tramps together, mostly in Richmond Park, where
Borrow appeared to know every tree and showed himself very
learned in deer.&nbsp; He was</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;always saying something in his loud,
self-asserting voice; sometimes stopping suddenly, drawing his
huge stature erect, and changing the keen and haughty expression
of his face into the rapt and half fatuous look of the oracle, he
would without preface recite some long fragment from Welsh or
Scandinavian bards, his hands hanging from his chest and flapping
in symphony.&nbsp; Then he would push on again, and as suddenly
stop, arrested by the beautiful scenery, and exclaim, &lsquo;Ah!
this is England, as the Pretender said when he again looked on
his fatherland.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then on reaching any town, he would
be sure to spy out some lurking gypsy, whom no one but himself
would have known from a common horse-dealer.&nbsp; A conversation
in Romany would ensue, a shilling would change hands, two fingers
would be pointed at the gypsy, and the interview would be at an
end.&rdquo; <a name="citation449a"></a><a href="#footnote449a"
class="citation">[449a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day he asked Dr Hake&rsquo;s youngest boy if he knew how
to fight a man bigger than himself, and on being told that he
didn&rsquo;t, advised him to &ldquo;accept his challenge, and
tell him to take off his coat, and while he was doing it knock
him down and then run for your life.&rdquo; <a
name="citation449b"></a><a href="#footnote449b"
class="citation">[449b]</a></p>
<p>Once Borrow arrived at Dr Hake&rsquo;s house to find another
caller in the person of Mr Theodore Watts-Dunton, and they
&ldquo;went through a pleasant trio, in which Borrow, as was his
wont, took the first fiddle . . . Borrow made himself agreeable
to Watts [-Dunton], recited a fairy tale in the best style to
him, and liked him.&rdquo; <a name="citation449c"></a><a
href="#footnote449c" class="citation">[449c]</a>&nbsp; Borrow did
not recognise in Mr Watts-Dunton the young man whom he had seen
bathing on the beach at Great Yarmouth, pleased to be near his
hero, but too much afraid to venture to address him.&nbsp;
Writing of this meeting at Coombe End, Mr Watts-Dunton says:
&ldquo;There is however no doubt that Borrow would have run away
from me had I been associated in his mind with the literary
calling.&nbsp; But at that time I had written nothing at all save
poems, and a prose story or two of a romantic kind.&rdquo; <a
name="citation450"></a><a href="#footnote450"
class="citation">[450]</a>&nbsp; Borrow hated the literary man,
he was at war with the whole genus.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Mr Watts-Dunton confesses that he made great efforts to enlist
Borrow&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; He touched on Bamfylde Moore
Carew, beer, bruisers, philology, &ldquo;gentility
nonsense,&rdquo; the &ldquo;trumpery great&rdquo;; but without
success.&nbsp; Borrow was obviously suspicious of him.&nbsp; Then
with inspiration he happened to mention what proved to be a magic
name.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I tried other subjects in the same
direction,&rdquo; Mr Watts-Dunton continues, &ldquo;but with
small success, till in a lucky moment I bethought myself of
Ambrose Gwinett, . . . the man who, after having been hanged and
gibbeted for murdering a traveller with whom he had shared a
double-bedded room at a seaside inn, revived in the night,
escaped from the gibbet-irons, went to sea as a common sailor,
and afterwards met on a British man-of-war the very man he had
been hanged for murdering.&nbsp; The truth was that
Gwinett&rsquo;s supposed victim, having been attacked on the
night in question by a violent bleeding of the nose, had risen
and left the house for a few minutes&rsquo; walk in the
sea-breeze, when the press-gang captured him and bore him off to
sea, where he had been in service ever since.&nbsp; The story is
true, and the pamphlet, Borrow afterwards told me (I know not on
what authority), was written by Goldsmith from Gwinett&rsquo;s
dictation for a platter of cow-heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the bewilderment of Dr Hake, I introduced the
subject of Ambrose Gwinett in the same manner as I might have
introduced the story of &lsquo;Achilles&rsquo; wrath,&rsquo; and
appealed to Dr Hake (who, of course, had never heard of the book
or the man) as to whether a certain incident in the pamphlet had
gained or lost by the dramatist who, at one of the minor
theatres, had many years ago dramatized the story.&nbsp; Borrow
was caught at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you
know that pamphlet about Ambrose Gwinett?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Know it?&rsquo; said I, in a hurt tone, as though he had
asked me if I knew &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo;; &lsquo;of course I know
Ambrose Gwinett, Mr Borrow, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And you know the play?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course I do, Mr Borrow,&rsquo; I said, in a tone that was now a
little angry at such an insinuation of crass ignorance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s years and years
since it was acted; I never was much of a theatre man, but I did
go to see <i>that</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well I should rather
think you <i>did</i>, Mr Borrow,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, staring hard at me,
&lsquo;you&mdash;you were not born!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And I was
not born,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;when the &ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo;
was produced, and yet one reads the &ldquo;Agamemnon,&rdquo; Mr
Borrow.&nbsp; I have read the drama of &ldquo;Ambrose
Gwinett.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have it bound in morocco, with some more
of Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s early transpontine plays, and some
&AElig;schylean dramas by Mr Fitzball.&nbsp; I will lend it to
you, Mr Borrow, if you like.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was completely
conquered, &lsquo;Hake!&rsquo; he cried, in a loud voice,
regardless of my presence, &lsquo;Hake! your friend knows
everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he murmured to himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wonderful man!&nbsp; Knows Ambrose Gwinett!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is such delightful reminiscences as these that will
cause me to have as long as I live a very warm place in my heart
for the memory of George Borrow.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[451a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, intercourse proved easy.&nbsp; At Borrow&rsquo;s
suggestion they walked to the Bald-Faced Stag, in Kingston Vale,
to inspect Jerry Abershaw&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; This famous old
hostelry was a favourite haunt of Borrow&rsquo;s, where he would
often rest during his walk and drink &ldquo;a cup of ale&rdquo;
(which he would call &ldquo;swipes,&rdquo; and make a wry face as
he swallowed) and talk of the daring deeds of Jerry the
highwayman.</p>
<p>Many people have testified to the pleasure of being in the
company of the whimsical, eccentric, humbug-hating Borrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was a choice companion on a walk,&rdquo;
writes Mr A. Egmont Hake, &ldquo;whether across country or in the
slums of Houndsditch.&nbsp; His enthusiasm for nature was
peculiar; he could draw more poetry from a wide-spreading marsh
with its straggling rushes than from the most beautiful scenery,
and would stand and look at it with rapture.&rdquo; <a
name="citation451b"></a><a href="#footnote451b"
class="citation">[451b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the tour in Wales in 1854, from which he returned with
the four &ldquo;Note Books,&rdquo; Borrow had been working
steadily at <i>Wild Wales</i>.&nbsp; In 1857 the book had been
announced as &ldquo;ready for the press&rdquo;; but this was
obviously an anticipation.&nbsp; The manuscript was submitted to
John Murray early in November 1861.&nbsp; On the 20th of that
month he wrote the following letter, addressing it, not to
Borrow, but to his wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs
Borrow</span>,&mdash;The MS. of <i>Wild Wales</i> has occupied my
thoughts almost ever since Friday last.</p>
<p>I approached this MS. with some diffidence, recollecting the
unsatisfactory results, on the whole, of our last
publication&mdash;<i>Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; I have read a large
part of this new work with care and attention, and although it is
beautifully written and in a style of English undefiled, which
few writers can surpass, there is yet a want of stirring incident
in it which makes me fearful as to the result of its
publication.</p>
<p>In my hands at least I cannot think it would succeed even as
well as <i>Romany Rye</i>&mdash;and I am fearful of not doing
justice to it.&nbsp; I do not like to undertake a work with the
chance of reproach that it may have failed through my want of
power to promote its circulation, and I do wish, for
Borrow&rsquo;s own sake, that in this instance he would try some
other publisher and perhaps some other form of publication.</p>
<p>In my hands I am convinced the work will not answer the
author&rsquo;s expectations, and I am not prepared to take on me
this amount of responsibility.</p>
<p>I will give the best advice I can if called upon, and shall be
only too glad if I can be useful to Mr Borrow.&nbsp; I regret to
have to write in this sense, but believe me always, Dear Mrs
Borrow,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your faithful friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">John
Murray</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reply to this letter has not been preserved.&nbsp; It
would appear that some &ldquo;stirring incidents&rdquo; were
added, among others most probably the account of Borrow blessing
the Irish reapers, who mistook him for Father Toban.&nbsp; This
anecdote was one of John Murray&rsquo;s favourite passages.&nbsp;
It is evident that some concession was made to induce Murray to
change his mind.&nbsp; In any case <i>Wild Wales</i> appeared
towards the close of 1862 in an edition of 1000 copies.&nbsp; The
publisher&rsquo;s misgivings were not justified, as the first
edition produced a profit, up to 30th June 1863, of &pound;531,
14s., which was equally divided between author and
publisher.&nbsp; The second, and cheap, edition of 3000 copies
lasted for thirteen years, and the deficiency on this absorbed
the greater part of the publisher&rsquo;s profit.</p>
<p>In a way it is the most remarkable of Borrow&rsquo;s books;
for it shows that he was making a serious effort to regain his
public.&nbsp; It is an older, wiser and chastened Borrow that
appears in its pages, striding through the land of the bards at
six miles an hour, his satchel slung over his shoulder, his green
umbrella grasped in his right hand, shouting the songs of Wales,
about which he knew more than any man he met.&nbsp; There are no
gypsies (except towards the end of the book a reference to his
meeting with Captain Bosvile), no bruisers, the pope is scarcely
mentioned, and &ldquo;gentility-nonsense&rdquo; is veiled almost
to the point of elimination.&nbsp; It seems scarcely conceivable
that the hand that had written the appendix to <i>The Romany
Rye</i> could have so restrained itself as to write <i>Wild
Wales</i>.&nbsp; Borrow had evidently read and carefully digested
Whitwell Elwin&rsquo;s friendly strictures upon <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; Instead of the pope, the gypsies and the bruisers
of England, there were the vicarage cat, the bards and the
thousand and one trivial incidents of the wayside.&nbsp; There
were occasional gleams of the old fighting spirit, notably when
he characterises sherry, <a name="citation453"></a><a
href="#footnote453" class="citation">[453]</a> as &ldquo;a silly,
sickly compound, the use of which will transform a nation,
however bold and warlike by nature, into a race of sketchers,
scribblers, and punsters,&mdash;in fact, into what Englishmen are
at the present day.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has created the atmosphere of
Wales as he did that of the gypsy encampment.&nbsp; He shows the
jealous way in which the Welsh cling to their language, and their
suspicion of the <i>Saesneg</i>, or Saxon.&nbsp; Above all, he
shows how national are the Welsh poets, belonging not to the
cultured few; but to the labouring man as much as to the landed
proprietor.&nbsp; Borrow earned the respect of the people, not
only because he knew their language; but on account of his
profound knowledge of their literature, their history, and their
traditions.&nbsp; No one could escape him, he accosted every soul
he met, and evinced a desire for information as to place-names
that instantly arrested their attention.</p>
<p>The most curious thing about <i>Wild Wales</i> is the omission
of all mention of the Welsh Gypsies, who, with those of Hungary,
share the distinction of being the aristocrats of their
race.&nbsp; Several explanations have been suggested to account
for the curious circumstance.&nbsp; Had Borrow&rsquo;s knowledge
of Welsh Romany been scanty, he could very soon have improved
it.&nbsp; The presence of his wife and stepdaughter was no
hindrance; for, as a matter of fact, they were very little with
him, even when they and Borrow were staying at Llangollen; but
during the long tours they were many miles away.&nbsp; In all
probability the Welsh Gypsies were sacrificed to British
prejudice, much as were pugilism and the baiting of the pope.</p>
<p>In spite of its simple charm and convincing atmosphere,
<i>Wild Wales</i> did not please the critics.&nbsp; Those who
noticed it (and there were many who did not) either questioned
its genuineness, or found it crowded with triviality and
self-glorification.&nbsp; It was full of the superfluous, the
superfluous repeated, and above all it was too long (some 250,000
words).&nbsp; <i>The Spectator</i> notice was an exception; it
did credit to the critical faculty of the man who wrote it.&nbsp;
He declined &ldquo;to boggle and wrangle over minor defects in
what is intrinsically good,&rdquo; and praised <i>Wild Wales</i>
as &ldquo;the first really clever book . . . in which an honest
attempt is made to do justice to Welsh literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had much time upon his hands in London, which he
occupied largely in walking.&nbsp; He visited the Metropolitan
Gypsyries at Wandsworth, &ldquo;the Potteries,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the Mounts,&rdquo; as described in <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>.&nbsp; Sometimes he would be present at some
sporting event, such as the race between the Indian Deerfoot and
Jackson, styled the American Deer&mdash;tame sport in comparison
with the &ldquo;mills&rdquo; of his boyhood.&nbsp; He did very
little writing, and from 1862, when <i>Wild Wales</i> appeared,
until he published <i>The Romano Lavo-Lil</i> in 1874, his
literary output consisted of only some translations contributed
to <i>Once a Week</i> (January 1862 to December 1863).</p>
<p>In 1865 he was to lose his stepdaughter, who married a William
MacOubrey, M.D., described in the marriage register as a
physician of Sloane Street, London, and subsequently upon his
tombstone as a barrister.&nbsp; In the July of 1866 Borrow and
his wife went to Belfast on a visit to the newly married
pair.&nbsp; From Belfast Borrow took another trip into Scotland,
crossing over to Stranraer.&nbsp; From there he proceeded to Glen
Luce and subsequently to Newton Stewart, Castle Douglas,
Dumfries, Ecclefechan, Gretna Green, Carlisle, Langholm, Hawick,
Jedburgh, Yetholm (where he saw Esther Blyth of Kirk Yetholm),
Kelso, Abbotsford, Melrose, Berwick, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and so
back to Belfast, having been absent for nearly four weeks.</p>
<p>Mrs Borrow&rsquo;s health had been the cause of the family
leaving Oulton for Great Yarmouth, and about the time of the
Irish visit it seems to have become worse.&nbsp; When Borrow was
away upon his excursion he received a letter at Carlisle in which
his wife informed him that she was not so well; but urging him
not to return if he were enjoying his trip and it were benefiting
his health.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the following year (1867) they were at
Bognor, Mrs Borrow taking the sea air, her husband tramping about
the country and penetrating into the New Forest.&nbsp; On their
return to town Mrs Borrow appears to have become worse.&nbsp;
There was much correspondence to be attended to with regard to
the Oulton Estate, and she had to go down to Suffolk to give her
personal attention to certain important details.&nbsp; Miss Cobbe
throws a little light on the period in a letter to a friend, in
which she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Borrow says his wife is very ill and
anxious to keep the peace with C. (a litigious neighbour).&nbsp;
Poor old B. was very sad at first, but I cheered him up and sent
him off quite brisk last night.&nbsp; He talked all about the
Fathers again, arguing that their quotations went to prove that
it was <i>not</i> our gospels they had in their hands.&nbsp; I
knew most of it before, but it was admirably done.&nbsp; I talked
a little theology to him in a serious way (finding him talk of
his &lsquo;horrors&rsquo;) and he abounded in my sense of the
non-existence of Hell, and of the presence and action on the soul
of <i>a</i> Spirit, rewarding and punishing.&nbsp; He would not
say &lsquo;God&rsquo;; but repeated over and over again that he
spoke not from books but from his own personal experience.&rdquo;
<a name="citation456"></a><a href="#footnote456"
class="citation">[456]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 24th January (1869) Mrs Borrow was taken suddenly ill and
the family doctor being out of town, Borrow sent for Dr W. S.
Playfair of 5 Curzon Street.&nbsp; A letter from Dr Playfair,
25th January, to the family doctor is the only coherent testimony
in existence as to what was actually the matter with Mrs
Borrow.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I found great difficulty in making out the
case exactly,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;since Mr Borrow himself
was so agitated that I could get no very clear account of
it.&nbsp; I could detect no marked organic affection about the
heart or lungs, of which she chiefly complained.&nbsp; It seemed
to me to be either a very aggravated form of hysteria, or, what
appears more likely, some more serious mental affection.&nbsp; In
any case, the chief requisite seemed very careful and intelligent
nursing or management, and I doubt very much, from what I saw,
whether she gets that with her present surroundings.&nbsp; If it
is really the more serious mental affection, I should fancy that
the sooner means are taken to have her properly taken care of,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Playfair saw in Borrow&rsquo;s highly nervous excitable
nature, if not the cause of his wife&rsquo;s breakdown, at least
an obstacle to her recovery, and was of opinion that Mrs
Borrow&rsquo;s disorder had been greatly aggravated by her
husband&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Mrs Borrow never rallied from the attack, and on the 30th she
died of &ldquo;valvular disease of the heart and dropsy,&rdquo;
being then in her seventy-seventh year.&nbsp; On 4th February she
was buried in Brompton Cemetery, and the lonely man, her husband,
returned to Hereford Square.&nbsp; The grave bears the
inscription, &ldquo;To the Beloved Memory of My Mother, Mary
Borrow, who fell asleep in Jesus, 30th January 1869.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is strange that this should be in Henrietta&rsquo;s and not
Borrow&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Mrs Borrow evidently made over her property to her husband
during her lifetime, as there is no will in existence, and no
application appears to have been made either by Borrow or anyone
else for letters of administration.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
JANUARY 1869&ndash;1881</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of his wife was a last
blow to Borrow, and he soon retired from the world.&nbsp; At
first he appears to have sought consolation in books, to judge
from the number of purchases he made about this time; but it was,
apparently, with pitiably unsuccessful results.&nbsp; In a letter
to a friend Miss Cobbe gives a picture in his lonliness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Poor old Borrow is in a sad state,&rdquo;
she wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he is starting in a day or two for
Scotland.&nbsp; I sent C. with a note begging him to come and eat
the Welsh mutton you sent me to-day, and he sent back word,
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, an hour afterwards, he arrived,
and in a most agitated manner said he had come to say &lsquo;he
would rather not.&nbsp; He would not trouble anyone with his
sorrows.&rsquo;&nbsp; I made him sit down, and talked as gently
to him as possible, saying: &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t be a trouble
Mr. Borrow, it will be a pleasure to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was
all of no use.&nbsp; He was so cross, so <i>rude</i>, I had the
greatest difficulty in talking to him.&nbsp; I asked about his
servant, and he said I could not help him.&nbsp; I asked him
about Bowring, and he said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; (It was some dispute with Sir John Bowring, who
was an acquaintance of mine, and with whom I offered to
mediate.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I asked him would he look at the photos of
the Siamese,&rsquo; and he said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t show them to
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; So, in despair, as he sat silent, I told him I
had been at a pleasant dinner-party the night before, and had met
Mr L&mdash;, who told me of certain curious books of
medi&aelig;val history.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did he know
them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, and he <i>dare said</i> Mr L&mdash;
did not, either!&nbsp; Who was Mr L&mdash;?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
described that <i>obscure</i> individual, (one of the foremost
writers of the day), and added that he was immensely liked by
everybody.&nbsp; Whereupon Borrow repeated at least twelve times,
&lsquo;Immensely liked!&nbsp; As if a man could be immensely
liked!&rsquo; quite insultingly.&nbsp; To make a diversion (I was
very patient with him as he was in trouble), &lsquo;I said I had
just come home from the Lyell&rsquo;s and had heard&mdash;&rsquo;
. . .&nbsp; But there was no time to say what I had heard!&nbsp;
Mr Borrow asked: &lsquo;Is that old Lyle I met here once, the man
who stands at the door (of some den or other) and
<i>bets</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; I explained who Sir Charles was, <a
name="citation459a"></a><a href="#footnote459a"
class="citation">[459a]</a> (of course he knew very well), but he
went on and on, till I said gravely: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think
you will meet those sort of people here, Mr Borrow.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t associate with blacklegs, exactly.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation459b"></a><a href="#footnote459b"
class="citation">[459b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Autumn of 1870 Borrow became acquainted with Charles G.
Leland (&ldquo;Hans Breitmann&rdquo;) as the result of receiving
from him the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Brighton</span>, 24<i>th</i> <i>October</i>
1870.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;During the eighteen
months that I have been in England, my efforts to find some
mutual friend who would introduce me to you have been quite in
vain.&nbsp; As the author of two or three works which have been
kindly received in England, I have made the acquaintance of many
literary men and enjoyed much hospitality; but I assure you very
sincerely that my inability to find you out or get at you has
been a source of great annoyance to me.&nbsp; As you never
published a book which I have not read through five
times&mdash;excepting <i>The Bible in Spain</i> and <i>Wild
Wales</i>, which I have only read once&mdash;you will perfectly
understand why I should be so desirous of meeting you.</p>
<p>As you have very possibly never heard of me before, I would
state that I wrote a collection of Ballads satirising Germany and
the Germans under the title of <i>Hans Breitmann</i>.</p>
<p>I never before in my life solicited the favour of any
man&rsquo;s acquaintance, except through the regular medium of an
introduction.&nbsp; If my request to be allowed the favour of
meeting and seeing you does not seem too <i>outr&eacute;</i>, I
would be to glad to go to London, or wherever you may be, if it
can be done without causing you any inconvenience, and if I
should not be regarded as an intruder.&nbsp; I am an American,
and among us such requests are <i>parfaitment</i> (sic) <i>en
r&eacute;gle</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Charles G.
Leland</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow replied on 2nd Nov.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have received your letter and am gratified by the desire you
express to make my acquaintance.</p>
<p>Whenever you please to come I shall be happy to see you.</p>
<p>Truly yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>. <a name="citation460a"></a><a href="#footnote460a"
class="citation">[460a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting unquestionably took place at Hereford Square, and
Leland found Borrow &ldquo;a tall, large, fine-looking man who
must have been handsome in his youth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation460b"></a><a href="#footnote460b"
class="citation">[460b]</a>&nbsp; The result of the interview was
that Leland sent to Borrow a copy of his <i>Ballads</i> and also
<i>The Music Lesson of Confucius</i>, then about to appear.&nbsp;
At the same time he wrote to Borrow drawing his attention to one
of the ballads written in German Romany <i>jib</i>, and enquiring
if it were worth anything.&nbsp; Whilst deprecating his
&ldquo;impudence&rdquo; in writing a Romany <i>gili</i> and
telling, as a pupil might a master, of his interest in and his
association with the gypsies, he continues: &ldquo;My dear Mr
Borrow, for all this you are entirely responsible.&nbsp; More
than twenty years ago your books had an incredible influence on
me, and now you see the results.&rdquo;&nbsp; After telling him
that he can <i>never</i> thank him sufficiently for the
instructions he has given in <i>The Romany Rye</i> as to how to
take care of a horse on a thirty mile ride, he
concludes&mdash;&ldquo;With apologies for the careless tone of
this letter, and with sincere thanks for your kindness in
permitting me to call on you and for your courteous note,&mdash;I
am your sincere admirer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The account that Leland gives of this episode in his
<i>Memoirs</i> is puzzling and contradictory in the light of his
first letter.&nbsp; He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was another hard old character with
whom I became acquainted in those days, and one who, though not a
Carlyle, still, like him, exercised in a peculiar way a great
influence on English literature.&nbsp; This was George
Borrow.&nbsp; I was in the habit of reading a great deal in the
British Museum, where he also came, and there I was introduced to
him. <a name="citation461a"></a><a href="#footnote461a"
class="citation">[461a]</a>&nbsp; [Leland seems to be in error
here; see <i>ante</i>, page 460.]&nbsp; He was busy with a
venerable-looking volume in old Irish, and made the remark to me
that he did not believe there was a man living who could read old
Irish with ease (which I now observe to myself was
&lsquo;fished&rsquo; out of Sir W. Betham).&nbsp; We discussed
several Gypsy words and phrases.&nbsp; I met him in the same
place several times.&rdquo; <a name="citation461b"></a><a
href="#footnote461b" class="citation">[461b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leland states that he sent a note to Borrow, care of John
Murray, asking permission to dedicate to him his forthcoming
book, <i>The English Gypsies and Their Language</i>; but received
no reply, although Murray assured him that the letter had been
received by Borrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;He received my note on the
Saturday,&rdquo; Leland writes&mdash;&ldquo;never answered
it&mdash;and on Monday morning advertised in all the journals his
own forthcoming work on the same subject.&rdquo; <a
name="citation461c"></a><a href="#footnote461c"
class="citation">[461c]</a>&nbsp; Had Borrow asked him to delay
publishing his own book, Leland says he would have done so,
&ldquo;for I had so great a respect for the Nestor of Gypsyism,
that I would have been very glad to have gratified him with such
a small sacrifice.&rdquo; <a name="citation462a"></a><a
href="#footnote462a" class="citation">[462a]</a></p>
<p>However Borrow may have heard that Leland had in preparation a
book on the English Gypsies, he seemed to feel that it was a
trespass upon ground that was peculiarly his own.&nbsp; Having
revised and prepared for the press the new edition of the Gypsy
St Luke for the Bible Society (published December 1872), and the
one-volume editions of <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>,
he set to work to forestall Leland with his own <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>.</p>
<p>In spite of his haste, however, Borrow was beaten in the race,
and Leland got his volume out first.&nbsp; When the <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i> <a name="citation462b"></a><a href="#footnote462b"
class="citation">[462b]</a> appeared in March 1874, Borrow found
what, in all probability he had not dreamed of, that the
thirty-three years intervening between its publication and that
of <i>The Zincali</i>, had changed the whole literary world as
regards &ldquo;things of Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1841 Borrow had
produced a unique book, such as only one man in England could
have written, and that man himself <a name="citation462c"></a><a
href="#footnote462c" class="citation">[462c]</a>; but in 1874 he
found himself not only out of date, but out-classed.</p>
<p>The title very thoroughly explains the scope of the
work.&nbsp; The Vocabulary had existed in manuscript for many
years.&nbsp; For some reason, difficult to explain, Borrow had
omitted from this Vocabulary a number of the gypsy words that
appeared in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; In
spite of this &ldquo;Mr Borrow&rsquo;s present vocabulary makes a
goodly show,&rdquo; wrote F. H. Groome, &ldquo;. . . containing
no fewer than fourteen hundred words, of which about fifty will
be entirely new to those who only know Romany in books.&rdquo; <a
name="citation463a"></a><a href="#footnote463a"
class="citation">[463a]</a></p>
<p>After praising the Gypsy songs as the best portion of the
book, Groome proceeds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of his prose I cannot say so much.&nbsp; It
is the Romany of the study rather than of the tents [!]&nbsp; Mr
Borrow has attempted to rehabilitate English Romany by enduing it
with forms and inflections, of which some are still rarely to be
heard, some extinct, and others absolutely incorrect; while Mr
Leland has been content to give it as it really is.&nbsp; Of the
two methods I cannot doubt that most readers will agree with me
in thinking that Mr Leland&rsquo;s is the more
satisfactory.&rdquo; <a name="citation463b"></a><a
href="#footnote463b" class="citation">[463b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> sternly rebuked Borrow for seeming
&ldquo;to make the mistake of confounding the amount of Rommanis
which he has collected in this book with the actual extent of the
language itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reviewer pays a somewhat
grudging tribute to other portions of the book, the accounts of
the Gypsyries and the biographical particulars of the Romany
worthies, but the work suffers by comparison with those of
Paspati and Leland.&nbsp; He acknowledges that Borrow was one of
the pioneers of those who gave accounts of the Gypsies in
English, who gave to many their present taste for Gypsy
matters,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;but,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;we cannot
allow merely sentimental considerations to prevent us from
telling the honest truth.&nbsp; The fact is that the <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i> is nothing more than a
<i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of the materials collected by Mr
Borrow at an early stage of his investigations, and nearly every
word and every phrase may be found in one form or another in his
earlier works.&nbsp; Whether or not Mr Borrow <i>has</i> in the
course of his long experience become the <i>deep</i> Gypsy which
he has always been supposed to be, we cannot say; but it is
certain that his present book contains little more than he gave
to the public forty years ago, and does not by any means
represent the present state of knowledge on the subject.&nbsp;
But at the present day, when comparative philology has made such
strides, and when want of accurate scholarship is as little
tolerated in strange and remote languages as in classical
literature, the <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i> is, to speak mildly, an
anachronism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notice, if Borrow read it, must have been very bitter to
him.&nbsp; All the loyalty to, and enthusiasm for, Borrow cannot
disguise the fact that his work, as far as the Gypsies were
concerned, was finished.&nbsp; He had first explored the path,
but others had followed and levelled it into a thoroughfare, and
Borrow found his facts and theories obsolete&mdash;a humiliating
discovery to a man so shy, so proud, and so sensitive.</p>
<p>The <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i> was Borrow&rsquo;s swan song.&nbsp;
He lived for another seven years; but as far as the world was
concerned he was dead.&nbsp; In an obituary notice of Robert
Latham, Mr Watts-Dunton tells a story that emphasizes how
thoroughly his existence had been forgotten.&nbsp; At one of Mrs
Procter&rsquo;s &ldquo;at homes&rdquo; he was talking of Latham
and Borrow, but when he happened to mention that both men were
still alive, that is in the early Seventies, and that quite
recently he had been in the company of each on separate
occasions, he found that he had lost caste in the eyes of his
hearers for talking about men as alive &ldquo;who were well known
to have been dead years ago.&rdquo; <a name="citation464"></a><a
href="#footnote464" class="citation">[464]</a></p>
<p>There is an interesting picture of Borrow as he appeared in
the Seventies, given by F. H. Groome, who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first time I ever saw him was at Ascot,
the Wednesday evening of the Cup week in, I think, the year
1872.&nbsp; I was stopping at a wayside inn, half-a-mile on the
Windsor road, just opposite which inn there was a great
encampment of Gypsies.&nbsp; One of their lads had on the Tuesday
affronted a soldier; so two or three hundred redcoats came over
from Windsor, intending to wreck the camp.&nbsp; There was a
babel of cursing and screaming, much brandishing of belts and
tent-rods, when suddenly an arbiter appeared, a white-haired,
brown-eyed, calm Colossus, speaking Romany fluently, and drinking
deep draughts of ale&mdash;in a quarter of an hour Tommy Atkins
and Anselo Stanley were sworn friends over a loving-quart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr Burroughs,&rdquo; said one of the Gypsies (it is the
name by which Gypsies still speak of him), and I knew that at
last I had met him whom of all men I most wished to meet.&nbsp;
Matty Cooper, the &lsquo;celebrated Windsor Frog&rsquo;
(<i>vide</i> Leland), presented me as &lsquo;a young gentleman,
<i>Rya</i>, a scholard from Oxford&rsquo;; and
&lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; quoth Colossus, &lsquo;a good many fools
come from Oxford.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a bad beginning, but it
ended well, by his asking me to walk with him to the station, and
on the way inviting me to call on him in London.&nbsp; I did so,
but not until nearly a twelve-month afterwards, when I found him
in Hereford Square, and when he set strong ale before me, as
again on the occasion of my third and last meeting with him in
the tent of our common acquaintance, Shadrach Herne, at the
Potteries, Notting Hill.&nbsp; Both these times we had much talk
together, but I remember only that it was partly about East
Anglia, and more about &lsquo;things of Egypt.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Conversations twenty years old are easy to imagine, hard to
reproduce . . .&nbsp; Probably Borrow asked me the Romany for
&lsquo;frying-pan,&rsquo; and I modestly answered, &lsquo;Either
<i>maasalli</i> or <i>tasseromengri</i>&rsquo; (this is password
No. 1), and then I may have asked him the Romany for
&lsquo;brick,&rsquo; to which he will have answered, that
&lsquo;there is no such word&rsquo; (this is No. 2).&nbsp; But
one thing I do remember, that he was frank and kindly,
interesting and interested; I was only a lad, and he was verging
on seventy.&nbsp; I could tell him about a few
&lsquo;travellers&rsquo; whom he had not recently
seen&mdash;Charlie Pinfold, the hoary polygamist, Plato and
Mantis Buckland, Cinderella Petulengro, and Old Tom Oliver
(&lsquo;Ha! so he has seen Tom Oliver,&rsquo; I seem to remember
that).&rdquo; <a name="citation466a"></a><a href="#footnote466a"
class="citation">[466a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was nothing now to keep Borrow in London.&nbsp; Nobody
wanted to read his books, other stars had risen in the
East.&nbsp; His publisher had exclaimed with energy, as Borrow
himself would relate, &ldquo;I want to meet with good writers,
but there are none to be had: I want a man who can write like
Ecclesiastes.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is something tragic in the
account that Mr Watts-Dunton gives of his last encounter with
Borrow:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The last time I ever saw him,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;was shortly before he left London to live in the
country.&nbsp; It was, I remember well, on Waterloo Bridge, where
I had stopped to gaze at a sunset of singular and striking
splendour, whose gorgeous clouds and ruddy mists were reeling and
boiling over the West-End.&nbsp; Borrow came up and stood leaning
over the parapet, entranced by the sight, as well he might
be.&nbsp; Like most people born in flat districts, he had a
passion for sunsets.&nbsp; Turner could not have painted that
one, I think, and certainly my pen could not describe it . . . I
never saw such a sunset before or since, not even on Waterloo
Bridge; and from its association with &lsquo;the last of
Borrow,&rsquo; I shall never forget it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation466b"></a><a href="#footnote466b"
class="citation">[466b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1874 Borrow withdrew to Oulton, there to end his lonely
life, his spirit seeming to enjoy the dreary solitude of the
Cottage, with its mournful surroundings.&nbsp; His stepdaughter,
the Henrietta of old, remained in London with her husband, and
Borrow&rsquo;s loneliness was complete.&nbsp; Sometimes he was to
be seen stalking along the highways at a great pace, wearing a
broad-brimmed hat and a Spanish cloak, a tragic figure of
solitude and despair, speaking to no one, no one daring to speak
to him, who locally was considered as &ldquo;a funny tempered
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a fragment of a letter from Edward FitzGerald to W. B.
Donne (June 1874), there is an interesting reference to
Borrow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
one little thing to tell you, which, little as it is, is worth
all the rest, if you don&rsquo;t know already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Borrow</i>&mdash;has got back to his own Oulton
Lodge.&nbsp; My Nephew, Edmund Kerrich, now Adjutant to some
Volunteer Battalion, wants a house <i>near</i>, not <i>in</i>,
Lowestoft: and got some Agent to apply for
Borrow&rsquo;s&mdash;who sent word that he is himself
there&mdash;an old Man&mdash;wanting Retirement, etc.&nbsp; This
was the account Edmund got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw in some Athen&aelig;um a somewhat contemptuous
notice of G. B.&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rommany Lil&rsquo; or whatever the
name is.&nbsp; I can easily understand that B. should not meddle
with <i>science</i> of any sort; but some years ago he would not
have liked to be told so, however Old Age may have cooled him
now.&rdquo; <a name="citation467"></a><a href="#footnote467"
class="citation">[467]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow sent a message to FitzGerald through Edmund Kerrich of
Geldeston, asking him to visit Oulton Cottage.&nbsp; The reply
shows all the sweetness of the writer&rsquo;s nature:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Little Grange</span>, <span
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>,<br />
<i>Jan.</i> 10/75.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;My nephew
Kerrich told me of a very kind invitation that you sent to me,
through him, some while ago.&nbsp; I think the more of it because
I imagine, from what I have heard, that you have slunk away from
human company as much&mdash;as I have!&nbsp; For the last fifteen
years I have not visited any one of my very oldest friends,
except the daughters of my old [?friend] George Crabbe, and
Donne&mdash;once only, and for half a day, just to assure myself
by&mdash;my own eyes how he was after the severe illness he had
last year, and which he never will quite recover from, I think;
though he looked and moved better than I expected.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;to tell you all about <i>why</i> I have thus fallen
from my company would be a tedious thing, and all about
one&rsquo;s self too&mdash;whom, Montaigne says, one never talks
about without detriment to the person talked about.&nbsp; Suffice
to say, &lsquo;so it is&rsquo;; and one&rsquo;s friends, however
kind and &lsquo;loyal&rsquo; (as the phrase goes), do manage to
exist and enjoy themselves pretty reasonably without one.</p>
<p>So with me.&nbsp; And is it not much the same with you
also?&nbsp; Are you not glad now to be mainly alone, and find
company a heavier burden than the grasshopper?&nbsp; If one ever
had this solitary habit, it is not likely to alter for the better
as one grows older&mdash;as one grows <i>old</i>.&nbsp; I like to
think over my old friends.&nbsp; There they are, lingering as
ineffaceable portraits&mdash;done in the prime of life&mdash;in
my memory.&nbsp; Perhaps we should not like one another so well
after a fifteen-years separation, when all of us change and most
of us for the worse.&nbsp; I do not say <i>that</i> would be your
case; but you must, at any rate, be less inclined to disturb the
settled repose into which you, I suppose, have fallen.&nbsp; I
remember first seeing you at Oulton, some twenty-five years ago;
then at Donne&rsquo;s in London; then at my own happy home in
Regent&rsquo;s Park; then <i>ditto</i> at Gorleston&mdash;after
which, I have seen nobody, except the nephews and nieces left me
by my good sister Kerrich.</p>
<p>So shall things rest?&nbsp; I could not go to you, after
refusing all this while to go to older&mdash;if not
better&mdash;friends, fellow Collegians, fellow schoolfellows;
and yet will you still believe me (as I hope <i>they</i> do)</p>
<p>Yours and theirs sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Edward
FitzGerald</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was still a remarkably robust man.&nbsp; Mr
Watts-Dunton tells how,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At seventy years of age, after breakfasting
at eight o&rsquo;clock in Hereford Square, he would walk to
Putney, meet one or more of us at Roehampton, roam about
Wimbledon and Richmond Park with us, bathe in the Fen Ponds with
a north-east wind cutting across the icy water like a razor, run
about the grass afterwards like a boy to shake off some of the
water-drops, stride about the park for hours, and then, after
fasting for twelve hours, eat a dinner at Roehampton that would
have done Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s eyes good to see.&nbsp;
Finally, he would walk back to Hereford Square, getting home late
at night.&nbsp; And if the physique of the man was bracing, his
conversation, unless he happened to be suffering from one of his
occasional fits of depression, was still more so.&nbsp; Its
freshness, raciness and eccentric whim no pen could
describe.&nbsp; There is a kind of humour the delight of which is
that while you smile at the pictures it draws, you smile quite as
much or more to think that there is a mind so whimsical,
crotchetty, and odd as to draw them.&nbsp; This was the humour of
Borrow.&rdquo; <a name="citation469a"></a><a href="#footnote469a"
class="citation">[469a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was seventy years of age when, one March day during a
bitterly-cold east wind, he stripped and plunged into one of the
Fen Ponds in Richmond Park, which was covered with ice, and dived
and swam under the water for a time, reappearing some distance
from the spot where he had entered the water. <a
name="citation469b"></a><a href="#footnote469b"
class="citation">[469b]</a></p>
<p>The remaining years of Borrow&rsquo;s life were spent in
Suffolk.&nbsp; He would frequently go to Norwich, however; for
the old city seemed to draw him irresistibly from his
hermitage.&nbsp; He would take a lodging there, and spend much of
his time occupying a certain chair in the Norfolk Hotel in St
Giles.&nbsp; There were so many old associations with Norwich
that made it appear home to him.&nbsp; He was possessed of
sentiment in plenty, it had caused his old mother to wish that
&ldquo;dear George would not have such fancies about <i>the old
house</i>&rdquo; in Willow Lane.</p>
<p>Later, Dr and Mrs MacOubrey removed to Oulton (about 1878),
and Borrow&rsquo;s life became less dismal and lonely; but he was
nearing his end.&nbsp; Sometimes there would be a flash of that
old unconquerable spirit.&nbsp; His stepdaughter relates how,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;on the 21st of November [1878], the place
[the farm] having been going to decay for fourteen months, Mr
Palmer [the tenant] called to demand that Mr Borrow should put it
in repair; otherwise he would do it himself and send in the
bills, saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the old farm or you
either,&rsquo; and several other insulting things; whereupon Mr
Borrow remarked very calmly, &lsquo;Sir, you came in by that
door, you can go out by it&rsquo;&mdash;and so it ended.&rdquo;
<a name="citation470a"></a><a href="#footnote470a"
class="citation">[470a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was on an occasion such as this that Borrow yearned for a
son to knock the rascal down.&nbsp; He was an infirm man, his
body feeling the wear and tear of the strenuous open-air life he
had led.&nbsp; In 1879, according to Mrs MacOubrey, he was
&ldquo;unable to walk as far as the white gate,&rdquo; the
boundary of his estate.&nbsp; He was obviously breaking-up very
rapidly.&nbsp; The surroundings appear to have reflected the
gloomy nature of the master of the estate.&nbsp; The house was
dilapidated, &ldquo;with everything about it more or less
untidy,&rdquo; <a name="citation470b"></a><a href="#footnote470b"
class="citation">[470b]</a> although at this period his income
amounted to upwards of five hundred pounds a year.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During his latter years,&rdquo; writes Mr
W. A. Dutt, &ldquo;his tall, erect, somewhat mysterious figure
was often seen in the early hours of summer mornings or late at
night on the lonely pathways that wind in and out from the banks
of Oulton Broad . . . the village children used to hush their
voices and draw aside at his approach.&nbsp; They looked upon him
with fear and awe. . . .&nbsp; In his heart, Borrow was fond of
the little ones, though it amused him to watch the impression his
strange personality made upon them.&nbsp; Older people he seldom
spoke to when out on his solitary rambles; but sometimes he would
flash out such a glance from beneath his broad-brimmed hat and
shaggy eyebrows as would make timid country folk hasten on their
way filled with vague thoughts and fears of the evil eye.&rdquo;
<a name="citation470c"></a><a href="#footnote470c"
class="citation">[470c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even to the last the old sensitiveness occasionally flashed
out, as on the occasion of a visit from the Vicar of Lowestoft,
who drove over with an acquaintance of Borrow&rsquo;s to make the
hermit&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; The visitor was so incautious
as to ask the age of his host, when, with Johnsonian emphasis,
came the reply: &ldquo;Sir, I tell my age to no man!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This occurred some time during the year 1880.&nbsp; Immediately
his discomfited guest had departed, Borrow withdrew to the
summer-house, where he drew up the following apothegm on
&ldquo;People&rsquo;s Age&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Never talk to people about their age.&nbsp;
Call a boy a boy, and he will fly into a passion and say,
&lsquo;Not quite so much of a boy either; I&rsquo;m a young
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Tell an elderly person that he&rsquo;s not so
young as he was, and you will make him hate you for life.&nbsp;
Compliment a man of eighty-five on the venerableness of his
appearance, and he will shriek out: &lsquo;No more venerable than
yourself,&rsquo; and will perhaps hit you with his
crutch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 1st December 1880 Borrow sent for his solicitor from
Lowestoft, and made his will, by which he bequeathed all his
property, real and personal, to his stepdaughter Henrietta,
devising that it should be held in trust for her by his friend
Elizabeth Harvey.&nbsp; It was evidently Borrow&rsquo;s intention
so to tie up the bequest that Dr MacOubrey could not in any way
touch his wife&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>The end came suddenly.&nbsp; On the morning of 26th July 1881
Dr and Mrs MacOubrey drove into Lowestoft, leaving Borrow alone
in the house.&nbsp; When they returned he was dead.&nbsp;
Throughout his life Borrow had been a solitary, and it seems
fitting that he should die alone.&nbsp; It has been urged against
his stepdaughter that she disregarded Borrow&rsquo;s appeals not
to be left alone in the house, as he felt himself to be
dying.&nbsp; He may have made similar requests on other
occasions; still, whatever the facts, it was strange to leave so
old and so infirm a man quite unattended.</p>
<p>On 4th August the body was brought to London, and buried
beside that of Mrs George Borrow in Brompton Cemetery.&nbsp; On
the stone, which is what is known as a saddle-back, is
inscribed:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">In

HOPE OF A GLORIOUS RESURRECTION.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fruitless effort was made by the late J. J. Colman of Carrow
to purchase the whole of Borrow&rsquo;s manuscripts, library, and
papers for the Carrow Abbey Library; but the price asked, a
thousand pounds, was considered too high, and they passed into
the possession of another.&nbsp; Eventually they found their way
into the reverent hands of the man who subsequently made Borrow
his hero, and who devoted years of his life to the writing of his
biography&mdash;Dr W. J. Knapp.</p>
<p>It was Borrow&rsquo;s fate, a tragic fate for a man so proud,
to outlive the period of his fame.&nbsp; Not only were his books
forgotten, but the world anticipated his death by some seven or
eight years.&nbsp; His was a curiously complex nature, one that
seems specially to have been conceived by Providence to arouse
enmity among the many, and to awaken in the hearts of the few a
sterling, unwavering friendship.&nbsp; It is impossible to
reconcile the accounts of those who hated him with those whose
love and respect he engaged.</p>
<p>He was in sympathy with vagrants and vagabonds&mdash;a taste
that was perhaps emphasised by the months he spent in preparing
<i>Celebrated Trials</i>.&nbsp; If those months of hack work
taught him sympathy with pariahs, it also taught him to write
strong, nervous English.</p>
<p>He was one of the most remarkable characters of his
century&mdash;whimsical, eccentric, lovable, inexplicable;
possessed of an odd, dry humour that sometimes failed him when
most he needed it.&nbsp; He lived and died a stranger to the
class to which he belonged, and was the intimate friend and
associate of that dark and mysterious personage, Mr
Petulengro.&nbsp; He hated his social equals, and admired
Tamerlane and Jerry Abershaw.&nbsp; It has been said <a
name="citation473"></a><a href="#footnote473"
class="citation">[473]</a> that he was born three centuries too
late, and that he belonged to the age when men dropped
mysteriously down the river in ships, later to return with
strange stories and great treasure from the Spanish Main.&nbsp;
Mr Watts-Dunton has said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Borrow was talking to people in his
own class of life there was always in his bearing a kind of shy,
defiant egotism.&nbsp; What Carlyle called the &lsquo;armed
neutrality&rsquo; of social intercourse oppressed him.&nbsp; He
felt himself to be in the enemy&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; In his eyes
there was always a kind of watchfulness, as if he were taking
stock of his interlocutor and weighing him against himself.&nbsp;
He seemed to be observing what effect his words were having, and
this attitude repelled people at first.&nbsp; But the moment he
approached a gypsy on the heath, or a poor Jew in Houndsditch, or
a homeless wanderer by the wayside, he became another man.&nbsp;
He threw off the burden of restraint.&nbsp; The feeling of the
&lsquo;armed neutrality&rsquo; was left behind, and he seemed to
be at last enjoying the only social intercourse that could give
him pleasure.&nbsp; This it was that enabled him to make friends
so entirely with the gypsies.&nbsp; Notwithstanding what is
called &lsquo;Romany guile&rsquo; (which is the growth of ages of
oppression), the basis of the Romany character is a joyous
frankness.&nbsp; Once let the isolating wall which shuts off the
Romany from the &lsquo;Gorgio&rsquo; be broken through, and the
communicativeness of the Romany temperament begins to show
itself.&nbsp; The gypsies are extremely close observers; they
were very quick to notice how different was Borrow&rsquo;s
bearing towards themselves from his bearing towards people of his
own race, and Borrow used to say that &lsquo;old Mrs Herne and
Leonora were the only gypsies who suspected and disliked
him.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation474a"></a><a
href="#footnote474a" class="citation">[474a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This convincing character sketch seems to show the real
Borrow.&nbsp; It accounts even for that high-piping, artificial
voice (a gypsy trait) that he assumed when speaking with those
who were not his intimate friends, and which any sudden interest
in the conversation would cause him to abandon in favour of his
own deep, rich tones.&nbsp; Mr F. J. Bowring, himself no friend
of Borrow&rsquo;s for very obvious reasons, has described this
artificial intonation as something between a beggar&rsquo;s whine
and the high-pitched voice of a gypsy&mdash;in sort, a
falsetto.&nbsp; He tells how, on one occasion, when in
conversation with Borrow, he happened to mention to him something
of particular interest concerning the gypsies, Borrow became
immensely interested, immediately dropped the falsetto and spoke
in his natural voice, which Mr Bowring describes as deep and
manly.</p>
<p>Even his friends were led sometimes into criticisms that
appear unsympathetic. <a name="citation474b"></a><a
href="#footnote474b" class="citation">[474b]</a>&nbsp; He was, Dr
Hake has said, &ldquo;essentially hypochondriacal.&nbsp; Society
he loved and hated alike: he loved it that he might be pointed
out and talked of; he hated it because he was not the prince that
he felt himself in its midst.&rdquo; <a
name="citation474c"></a><a href="#footnote474c"
class="citation">[474c]</a>&nbsp; It is the son who shows the
better understanding, although there is no doubt about Dr
Hake&rsquo;s loyalty to Borrow.&nbsp; There is a faithful
presentation of a man such as Borrow really seems to have been,
in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Few men have ever made so deep an
impression on me as George Borrow.&nbsp; His tall, broad figure,
his stately bearing, his fine brown eyes, so bright yet soft, his
thick white hair, his oval beardless face, his loud rich voice
and bold heroic air were such as to impress the most indifferent
lookers-on.&nbsp; Added to this there was something not easily
forgotten in the manner in which he would unexpectedly come to
our gates, singing some gypsy song, and as suddenly
depart.&rdquo; <a name="citation475a"></a><a href="#footnote475a"
class="citation">[475a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Borrow wrote that he was ashamed of being an Englishman and
referred to their &ldquo;pinched and mortified
expressions,&rdquo; if he found the virtues of the Saxons
&ldquo;uncouth and ungracious,&rdquo; he never permitted others
to make disparaging remarks about his country or his countrymen.
<a name="citation475b"></a><a href="#footnote475b"
class="citation">[475b]</a>&nbsp; He was typically English in
this: agree with his strictures, add a word or two of dispraise
of the English, and there appeared a terrifying figure of a
patriot; &ldquo;not only an Englishman but an East
Englishman,&rdquo; which in Borrow&rsquo;s vocabulary meant the
finest of the breed.&nbsp; He might with more truth have said a
Cornishman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not command myself when I heard
my own glorious land traduced in this unmerited manner,&rdquo; <a
name="citation475c"></a><a href="#footnote475c"
class="citation">[475c]</a> he once exclaimed.&nbsp; He permitted
to himself, and to himself only, a certain latitude in such
matters.</p>
<p>That Borrow exaggerated is beyond all question, but it must
not be called deliberate.&nbsp; He desired to give impressions of
scenes and people, and he was inclined to emphasize certain
features.&nbsp; Isopel Berners he wished it to be known was a
queenly creature, and he described her as taller than himself (he
was 6 feet 2 inches without his shoes).&nbsp; Exaggeration is
colour, not form.&nbsp; A disbelief in his having encountered the
convict son of the old apple-woman near Salisbury does not imply
that the old woman herself is a fiction.&nbsp; Borrow insisted
upon Norfolk as his county, &ldquo;where the people eat the best
dumplings in the world, and speak the purest
English.&rdquo;&nbsp; He even spoke with a strong, if imperfect,
East Anglian accent.&nbsp; As a matter of fact his father was
Cornish and his mother of Huguenot stock.&nbsp; It would be
absurd to argue from this obvious exaggeration of the actual
facts that Borrow was a myth.</p>
<p>Then he has been taken to task for not being a philologist as
well as a linguist.&nbsp; He may have used the word philologist
somewhat loosely on occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think what the reader
would have lost,&rdquo; says one eminent but by no means
prejudiced critic <a name="citation476"></a><a
href="#footnote476" class="citation">[476]</a> with real sympathy
and insight, &ldquo;had Borrow waited to verify his
etymologies.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all probability Nature will never
produce a Humboldt-Le Sage combination of intellect.&nbsp;
Language was to Borrow merely the key that permitted him access
to the chamber of men&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; It must be confessed
that sometimes he invaded the sacred precincts of
philology.&nbsp; His chapter on the Basque language in <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> has been described as &ldquo;utterly
frantic,&rdquo; and German philologists, speechless in their
astonishment, have expressed themselves upon his conclusions in
marks of exclamation!&nbsp; He was not qualified to discourse
upon the science of language.</p>
<p>He was a staunch member of the Church of England, because he
believed there was in it more religion than in any other Church;
but this did not hinder him from consorting with the godless
children of the tents, or contributing towards the upkeep of
Nonconformist-schools.&nbsp; The gypsies honoured and trusted him
because, crooked themselves, they appreciated straightness and
clean living in another.&nbsp; They had never known him use a bad
word or do a bad thing.&nbsp; He was, on occasion, arrogant,
overbearing, ungracious, in short all the unattractive things
that a proud and masterful man can be; but his friendship was as
strong as the man himself; his charity above the narrow
prejudices of sect.&nbsp; When he threw his tremendous power into
any enterprise or undertaking, it was with the determination that
it should succeed, if work and self-sacrifice could make
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wisest course,&rdquo; he thought, was,
&ldquo; . . . to blend the whole of the philosophy of the
tombstone with a portion of the philosophy of the publican and
something more, to enjoy one&rsquo;s pint and pipe and other
innocent pleasures, and to think every now and then of death and
judgment.&rdquo; <a name="citation477"></a><a href="#footnote477"
class="citation">[477]</a></p>
<p>Borrow loved mystery for its own sake, and none were ever able
quite to penetrate into the inner fastness of his
personality.&nbsp; Those who came nearest to it were probably
Hasfeldt and Ford, whose persistent good-humour was an armour
against a reserve that chilled most men.&nbsp; Of all
Borrow&rsquo;s friends it is probable that none understood him so
well as Hasfeldt.&nbsp; He recognised the strength of character
of the white-haired man who sang when he was happy, and he
refused to be affected by his gloomy moods.&nbsp; &ldquo;Write
and tell me,&rdquo; he requests, &ldquo;if you have not fallen in
love with some nun or Gypsy in Spain, or have met with some other
romantic adventure worthy of a roaming knight.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
another occasion (June 1845) he boasts with some justification,
&ldquo;Heaven be praised, I can comprehend you as a reality,
while many regard you as an imaginary, fantastic being.&nbsp; But
they who portray you have not eaten bread and salt with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s contemporary recognition was a chance; he was
writing for another generation, and some of the friends that he
left behind have loyally striven to erect to him the only
monument an artist desires&mdash;the proclaiming of his
works.</p>
<p>Nature it appeared had framed Borrow in a moment of
magnificence, and, lest he should be enticed away from her, had
instilled into his soul a hatred of all things artificial and at
variance with her august decrees.&nbsp; He was shy and suspicious
with the men and women who regulated their lives by the narrow
standards of civilisation and decorum; but with the children of
the tents and the vagrants of the wayside he was a single-minded
man, eager to learn the lore of the open air.&nbsp; He recognised
in these vagabonds the true sons and daughters of &ldquo;the
Great Mother who mixes all our bloods.&rdquo;</p>

nomenclature, each tribe or family having a public and private
name, one by which they are known to the Gentiles, and another to
themselves alone . . .&nbsp; There are only two names of trades
which have been adopted by English gypsies as proper names,
Cooper and Smith: these names are expressed in the English gypsy
dialect by <i>Vardo-mescro</i> and <i>Petulengro</i> (<i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>, page 185).&nbsp; Thus the Smiths are known among
themselves as the Petulengros.&nbsp; Petul, a horse shoe, and
engro a &ldquo;masculine affix used in the formation of

brought home to his family by his uncle.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is,

15th October 1862, John Longe, J.P., of Spixworth Park, Norwich,
in acknowledging some biographical particulars that Borrow had
sent him for inclusion in Burton&rsquo;s <i>Antiquities of the
Royal School of Norwich</i>, wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have omitted an important and
characteristic anecdote of your early days (fifteen years of
age).&nbsp; When at school you, with Theodosius and Francis W.
Purland, <i>absented</i> yourself from home and school and took
up your abode in a certain &lsquo;Robber&rsquo;s Cave&rsquo; at
Acle, where you <i>resided</i> three days, and once more returned
to your homes.&rdquo;</p>

manuscript of <i>Lavengro</i>, it appears that Roger Kerrison, a

class="footnote">[27a]</a>&nbsp; The Rev. Wm. Drake of Mundesley,
in a letter which appeared in <i>The Eastern Daily Press</i>,
22nd September 1892:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo; . . . I was at the Norwich Grammar School
nine years, from 1820 to 1829, and during that time (probably in
1824 and 1825) George Borrow was lodging in the Upper Close . .
.&nbsp; The house was a low old-fashioned building with a garden
in front of it, and the fact of Borrow&rsquo;s residence there is
fixed in my memory because I had spent the first five or six
years of my own life in the same house, from 1811 to 1816 or
1817.&nbsp; My father occupied it in virtue of his being a minor
canon in Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp; I remember Borrow very
distinctly, because he was fond of chatting with the boys, who
used to gather round the railings of his garden, and occasionally
he would ask one or two of them to have tea with him.&nbsp; I
have a faint recollection that he gave us some of our first
notions of chess, but I am not sure of this.&nbsp; I . . .
remember him a tall, spare, dark-complexioned man, usually
dressed in black.&nbsp; In person he was not unlike another
Norwich man, who obtained in those days a very different
notoriety from that which now belongs to Borrow&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; I mean John Thurtell, who murdered Mr
Weare.&rdquo;</p>

of these days:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;How much more happy, innocent,

<p><a name="footnote30a"></a><a href="#citation30a"

became possessed of a copy of <i>Ki&aelig;mpe Viser</i>, first
collected by Anders Vedel, which may or may not have been given
to him, with a handshake from the old farmer and a kiss from his
wife, in recognition of the attention he had shown the pair in
his official capacity.&nbsp; He refers to the volume repeatedly
in <i>Lavengro</i>, and narrates how it was presented by some
shipwrecked Danish mariners to the old couple in acknowledgment
of their humanity and hospitality.&nbsp; It is, however, most
likely that he was in error when he stated that &ldquo;in less
than a month&rdquo; he was able &ldquo;to read the
book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lavengro</i>, pages 140&ndash;4.</p>

There is an interesting letter written to Borrow by the old
lawyer&rsquo;s son on the appearance of <i>Lavengro</i>, in which
he says: &ldquo;With tearful eyes, yet smiling lips, I have read
and re-read your faithful portrait of my dear old father.&nbsp; I
cannot mistake him&mdash;the creaking shoes, the florid face, the
polished pate&mdash;all serve as marks of recognition to his

conclusively that Sir Richard was to be seen in London in the

as &ldquo;William Gifford, editor of <i>The Quarterly Review</i>

i. 93.)&nbsp; The late Sir Leslie Stephen, however, cast very
serious doubt upon this identification, himself concluding that
the editor of <i>The Universal Review</i> was John Carey
(1756&ndash;1826), whose name was actually associated with an
edition of Quintilian published in 1822.&nbsp; Carey was a known
contributor to two of Sir Richard Phillips&rsquo; magazines.</p>

indicating that he was imprisoned at Pamplona in 1826.&nbsp; The

and another unknown.&nbsp; The occasion on which he was nearly
shot, which may be assumed to be connected with one of the

seized as a Carlist spy &ldquo;by the fishermen of the place, who

hymn to translate into the Manchu language, and the same to one
of their own people to translate also.&nbsp; When compared they
proved to be very different.&nbsp; When put before their reader,
he had the candour to say that Borrow&rsquo;s was much the better
of the two.&nbsp; On this they sent him to St Petersburg, got it
printed [!] and then gave him business in Portugal, which he took
the liberty greatly to extend, and to do such good as occurred to

apropos of the project: &ldquo;You know the Russian priesthood
cannot suffer foreigners to mix themselves up in the affairs of

New Testament itself.&nbsp; You may certainly print in the

amazing.&nbsp; The object of distributing the Scriptures was to
enlighten men&rsquo;s minds and bring about conversion, and a
priest was a distinct capture, more valuable by far than a
peasant, and likely to influence others; yet when they had got
him no one appears to have known exactly what to do, and all were
anxious to get rid of him again.</p>

well-deserved tribute to this queen among landladies.&nbsp;
(<i>The Bible in Spain</i>, pages 256&ndash;7.)&nbsp; She was
always his friend and frequently his counsellor, thinking nothing
of the risk she ran in standing by him during periods of
danger.&nbsp; She refused all inducements to betray him to his
enemies, and, thoroughly deserved the eulogy that Borrow
pronounced upon her.</p>
<p><a name="footnote234c"></a><a href="#citation234c"

the arrest was ordered because Borrow had refused to recognise
the Civil Governor&rsquo;s authority and made use &ldquo;of
offensive expressions&rdquo; towards his person.&nbsp; The Civil
Governor had no authority over British subjects, and Borrow was
right in his refusal to acknowledge his jurisdiction.</p>

Carlos Has Committed His Cause and the Ignorance which It
Displays.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p><i>Page</i> 17.&nbsp; You will readily see in all those
grandiose epithets showered upon Mary, the work of the enemy of
God, which tending essentially towards idolatry has managed,
under the cloak of Christianity, to introduce idolatry, and
endeavours to divert to a creature, and even to the image of that
creature, the adoration which is due to God alone.&nbsp; Without
doubt it is with this very object that on all sides we see
erected statues of Mary, adorned with a crown, and bearing in her
arms a child of tender years, as though to accustom the populace
intimately to the idea of Mary&rsquo;s superiority over
Jesus.</p>
<p><i>Page</i> 30.&nbsp; This, then, is our conclusion.&nbsp; In
recognising and sanctioning this cult, the Church of Rome
constitutes itself an idolatrous Church, and every member of it
who is incapable of detecting the truth behind the monstrous
accumulation of impieties with which they veil it, is proclaimed
by the Church as condemned to perdition.&nbsp; The guiding light
of this Church, which they are not ashamed to smother or to
procure the smothering of, by which nevertheless they hold their
authority, to be plain, the word of God, should at least teach
them, if they set any value on the Spirit of Christ, that their
Papal Bulls would be better directed to the cleansing of the
Roman Church from all its iniquities than to the promulgation of
such unjust prohibitions.&nbsp; Yet in struggling against better
things, this Church is protecting and hallowing in all directions
an innumerable collection of superstitions and false cults, and
it is clear that by this means it is abased and labelled as one
of the principal agents of Anti-Christ.</p>

notes, have been exposed for sale, which have been deposited with
the political chiefs of the said provinces, or in the hands of
such persons as the chiefs have entrusted with them in Deposit;
it being necessary further to observe that the parties giving
them up have uniformly stated that they belonged to Mr Borrow,
and that they were commissioned by him to sell and dispose of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under these circumstances, Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government have deemed it expedient that I should address your
Excellency, in order that the above may be intimated to the
beforementioned Mr Borrow, so that he may take care that the
copies in question, as well as those which have been seized in
this City, and which are packed up in cases or parcels marked and
sealed, may be sent out of the Kingdom of Spain, agreeably to the
Royal order with which your Excellency is already acquainted, and
through the medium of the respective authorities who will be able
to vouch for their Exportation.&nbsp; To this Mr Borrow will
submit in the required form, and with the understanding that he

Hansard&rsquo;s summary reads: &ldquo;It might have been said, to
Mr Borrow with respect to Spain, that it would be impossible to
distribute the Bible in that country in consequence of the danger
of offending the prejudices which prevail there; yet he, a
private individual, by showing some zeal in what he believed to
be right, succeeded in triumphing over many obstacles.&rdquo;</p>

Watts-Dunton, in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 25th March 1899, has
been successful in giving a convincing picture of Borrow:
&ldquo;As to his countenance,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;&lsquo;noble&rsquo; is the only word that can be used to
describe it.&nbsp; The silvery whiteness of the thick crop of
hair seemed to add in a remarkable way to the beauty of the
hairless face, but also it gave a strangeness to it, and this
strangeness was intensified by a certain incongruity between the
features (perfect Roman-Greek in type), and the Scandinavian
complexion, luminous and sometimes rosy as an English
girl&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An increased intensity was lent by the fair
skin to the dark lustre of the eyes.&nbsp; What struck the
observer, therefore, was not the beauty but the strangeness of
the man&rsquo;s appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I admire in Borrow to such a degree that before it
his faults or failings seem very trifling, is his absolutely
vigorous, marvellously varied originality, based on direct
familiarity with Nature, but guided and cultured by the study of
natural, simple writers, such as Defoe and Smollett.&nbsp; I
think that the &lsquo;interest&rsquo; in, or rather sympathy for
gypsies, in his case as in mine, came not from their being
curious or dramatic beings, but because they are so much a part
of free life, of out-of-doors Nature; so associated with
sheltered nooks among rocks and trees, the hedgerow and birds,
river-sides, and wild roads.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s heart was large
and true as regarded English rural life; there was a place in it
for everything which was of the open air and freshly
beautiful.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Memoirs</i> of C. G. Leland, 1893.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
